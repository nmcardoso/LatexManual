<h3 class="section"><code>\ </code> after control sequence</h3>

<p>The <code>\ </code> command is often used after control sequences to keep
them from gobbling the space that follows, as in &#8216;<samp>\TeX\ is nice</samp>&#8217;.
And, under normal circumstances, <code>\</code><tt class="key">tab</tt> and
<code>\</code><tt class="key">newline</tt> are equivalent to <code>\ </code>. For another use of
<code>\ </code>, see also <a href="g_t_005c_0028SPACE_0029-and-_005c_0040.html">\(SPACE) and \@</a>.
</p>
<p>Some people prefer to use <code>{}</code> for the same purpose, as in
<code>\TeX{} is nice</code>. This has the advantage that you can always
write it the same way, namely <code>\TeX{}</code>, whether it is followed
by a space or by a punctuation mark. Compare:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\TeX\ is a nice system. \TeX, a nice system.

\TeX{} is a nice system. \TeX{}, a nice system.
</pre></div>

<a name="index-xspace-package"></a>
<p>Some individual commands, notably those defined with the <code>xspace</code>,
package do not follow the standard behavior.
