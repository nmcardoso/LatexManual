<h3 class="section"><code>\/</code>: Insert italic correction</h3>

<a name="index-_005c_002f"></a>
<a name="index-italic-correction"></a>

<p>The <code>\/</code> command produces an <em>italic correction</em>.  This is a
small space defined by the font designer for a given character,
to avoid the character colliding with whatever follows.  The italic
<i>f</i> character typically has a large italic correction value.
</p>
<p>If the following character is a period or comma, it&#8217;s not necessary to
insert an italic correction, since those punctuation symbols have a
very small height.  However, with semicolons or colons, as well as
normal letters, it can help. Compare
<i>f: f;</i> (in the TeX output, the &#8216;f&#8217;s are nicely separated)
with <i>f: f;</i>.
</p>
<p>When changing fonts with commands such as <code>\textit{italic
text}</code> or <code>{\itshape italic text}</code>, LaTeX will
automatically insert an italic correction if appropriate (see <a href="Font-styles.html">Font styles</a>).
</p>
<p>Despite the name, roman characters can also have an italic
correction.  Compare
pdfTeX (in the TeX output, there is a small space after the &#8216;f&#8217;)
with pdfTeX.
</p>
<p>There is no concept of italic correction in math mode; spacing is done
in a different way.
