<p>This declaration (from Plain TeX) causes LaTeX to treat
inter-sentence spacing in the same way as interword spacing.
</p>
<p>In justifying the text in a line, some typographic traditions, including
English, prefer to adjust the space between sentences (or after other
punctuation marks) more than the space between words.  Following this
declaration, all spaces are instead treated equally.
</p>
<p>Revert to the default behavior by declaring <code>\nonfrenchspacing</code>.
