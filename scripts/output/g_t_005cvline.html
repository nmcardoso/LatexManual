<h4 class="subsection"><code>\vline</code></h4>

<a name="index-_005cvline"></a>
<p>Draw a vertical line in a <code>tabular</code> or <code>array</code> environment
extending the full height and depth of an entry&#8217;s row.  Can also be
used in an @-expression, although its synonym vertical
bar <code>|</code> is more common.  This command is rarely used in the
body of a table; typically a table&#8217;s vertical lines are specified in
<code>tabular</code>&#8217;s <var>cols</var> argument and overridden as needed with
<code>\multicolumn</code>.
</p>
<p>This example illustrates some pitfalls.  In the first line&#8217;s second
entry the <code>\hfill</code> moves the <code>\vline</code> to the left edge of the
cell.  But that is different than putting it halfway between the two
columns, so in that row between the first and second columns there are
two vertical rules, with the one from the <code>{c|cc}</code> specifier
coming before the one produced by the <code>\vline\hfill</code>.  In contrast,
the first line&#8217;s third entry shows the usual way to put a vertical bar
between two columns.  In the second line, the <code>ghi</code> is the widest
entry in its column so in the <code>\vline\hfill</code> the <code>\hfill</code> has
no effect and the vertical line in that entry appears immediately next
to the <code>g</code>, with no whitespace.
