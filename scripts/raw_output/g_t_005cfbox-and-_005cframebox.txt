        Synopses:   \fbox{text} \framebox[width][position]{text}   The \fbox and \framebox commands are like \mbox, except that they put a frame around the outside of the box being created.  In addition, the \framebox command allows for explicit specification of the box width with the optional width argument (a dimension), and positioning with the optional position argument.    Both commands produce a rule of thickness \fboxrule (default .4pt), and leave a space of \fboxsep (default 3pt) between the rule and the contents of the box.  See \framebox (picture), for the \framebox command in the picture environment.
