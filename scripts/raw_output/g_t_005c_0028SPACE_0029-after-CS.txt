     The \  command is often used after control sequences to keep them from gobbling the space that follows, as in \TeX\ is a nice system.  And, under normal circumstances \tab and \newline are equivalent to \ . For other use of \ , see also \(SPACE) and \@.  Some people prefer to use {} for the same purpose, as in \TeX{} is a nice system. This has the advantage that you can always write it the same way, like \TeX{}, whether it is followed by a space or by a punctuation mark. Please compare:   \TeX\ is a nice system. \TeX, a nice system.  \TeX{} is a nice system. \TeX{}, a nice system.    When you define user commands (see \newcommand & \renewcommand) you can prevent the space gobbling after the command by using the package xspace and inserting \xspace at the end of the definition For instance:  \documentclass{minimal} \usepackage{xspace} \newcommand*{\Loup}{Grand Cric\xspace} \begin{document} Que le \Loup me croque ! \end{document}   A quick hack to use \xspace for existing command is as follows:  \documentclass{minimal} \usepackage{xspace} \newcommand*{\SansXspaceTeX}{} \let\SansXspaceTeX\TeX \renewcommand{\TeX}{\SansXspaceTeX\xspace} \begin{document} \TeX is a nice system. \end{document}
