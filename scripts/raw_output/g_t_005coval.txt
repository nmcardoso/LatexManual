       Synopsis:   \oval(width,height)[portion]   The \oval command produces a rectangle with rounded corners.  The optional argument portion allows you to produce only half of the oval via the following:   t selects the top half;  b selects the bottom half;  r selects the right half;  l selects the left half.    It is also possible to produce only one quarter of the oval by setting portion to tr, br, bl, or tl.  The corners of the oval are made with quarter circles with a maximum radius of 20pt, so large ovals will look more like boxes with rounded corners.
