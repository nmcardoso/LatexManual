    Synopsis:   \makeatletter   ... definition of commands with @ in their name .. \makeatother   Used to redefine internal LaTeX commands.  \makeatletter makes the at-sign character@ have the category code of a letter, 11.  \makeatother sets the category code of@ to 12, its original value.  As each character is read by TeX for LaTeX, it is assigned a character category code, or     catcode for shorter. For instance, the backslash\ is assigned the catcode 0, for characters that start a command.  These two commands alter the catcode assigned to @.  The alteration is needed because many of LaTeXs commands use @ in their name, to prevent users from accidentally defining a command that replaces one of LaTeXs own.  Command names consist of a category0 character, ordinarily backslash, followed by letters, category11 characters (except that a command name can also consist of a category0 character followed by a single non-letter symbol). So under the default category codes, user-defined commands cannot contain an @.  But \makeatletter and \makeatother allow users to define or redefine commands named with @.  Use these inside a .tex file, in the preamble.  Dont use them inside .sty or .cls files since the \usepackage and \documentclass commands set the at sign to have the character code of a letter.  The example code below, if put in the preamble, redefines the section command to center the section title, put it in bold type, and adjust the spacing.   \makeatletter \renewcommand\section{%   \@startsection{section}% Name   {1}% Level: 0=part, 1=chapter, etc.   {0pt}% Heading indent   {-3.5ex plus -1ex minus -.2ex}% Beforeskip (if neg, no head indent)   {2.3ex plus.2ex}% Afterskip (if neg, run-in heading)   {\centering\normalfont\Large\bfseries}} % Style of head \makeatother
