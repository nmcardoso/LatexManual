       Synopsis:   \hspace{length} \hspace*{length}   Add the horizontal space given by length.  The length is a rubber length, that is, it may contain a plus or minus component, in any unit that LaTeX understands (see Lengths).  This command can add both positive and negative space; adding negative space is like backspacing.  Normally when TeX breaks a paragraph into lines it discards white space (glues and kerns) that would come at the start of a line, so you get an inter-word space or a line break between words but not both. This commands starred version \hspace*{...} puts a non-discardable invisible item in front of the space, so the space appears in the output.  This example make a one-line paragraph that puts Name: an inch from the right margin.   \noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\hspace{\fill}Name:\hspace{1in}}
