             Synopsis:   \begin{verbatim} literal-text \end{verbatim}   The verbatim environment is a paragraph-making environment in which LaTeX produces exactly what you type in; for instance the \ character produces a printed \.  It turns LaTeX into a typewriter with carriage returns and blanks having the same effect that they would on a typewriter.  The verbatim uses a monospaced typewriter-like font (\tt).    \verb:The macro form of the verbatim environment.
