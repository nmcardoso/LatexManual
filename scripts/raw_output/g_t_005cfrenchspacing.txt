         This declaration (from Plain TeX) causes LaTeX to treat inter-sentence spacing in the same way as interword spacing.  In justifying the text in a line, some typographic traditions, including English, prefer to adjust the space between sentences (or after other punctuation marks) more than the space between words.  Following this declaration, all spaces are instead treated equally.  Revert to the default behavior by declaring \nonfrenchspacing.
