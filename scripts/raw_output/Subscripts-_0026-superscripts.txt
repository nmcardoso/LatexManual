           In math mode, use the caret character^ to make the exp appear as a superscript: ^{exp}. Similarly, in math mode, underscore_{exp} makes a subscript out of exp.  In this example the 0 and 1 appear as subscripts while the 2 is a superscript.   \( (x_0+x_1)^2 \)   To have more than one character in exp use curly braces as in e^{-2x}.  LaTeX handles superscripts on superscripts, and all of that stuff, in the natural way, so expressions such as e^{x^2} and x_{a_0} will look right.  It also does the right thing when something has both a subscript and a superscript.  In this example the 0 appears at the bottom of the integral sign while the 10 appears at the top.    \int_0^{10} x^2 \,dx   You can put a superscript or subscript before a symbol with a construct such as {}_t K^2 in math mode (the initial {} prevents the prefixed subscript from being attached to any prior symbols in the expression).  Outside of math mode, a construct like A test$_\textnormal{subscript}$ will produce a subscript typeset in text mode, not math mode.  Note that there are packages specialized for writing Chemical formulas such as mhchem.
