        The \/ command produces an italic correction.  This is a small space defined by the font designer for a given character, to avoid the character colliding with whatever follows.  The italic f character typically has a large italic correction value.  If the following character is a period or comma, its not necessary to insert an italic correction, since those punctuation symbols have a very small height.  However, with semicolons or colons, as well as normal letters, it can help. Compare f: f; (in the TeX output, the fs are nicely separated) with f: f;.  When changing fonts with commands such as \textit{italic text} or {\itshape italic text}, LaTeX will automatically insert an italic correction if appropriate (see Font styles).  Despite the name, roman characters can also have an italic correction.  Compare pdfTeX (in the TeX output, there is a small space after the f) with pdfTeX.  There is no concept of italic correction in math mode; spacing is done in a different way.
