       A length is a measure of distance.  Many LaTeX commands take a length as an argument.  Lengths come in two types.  A rigid length (what Plain TeX calls a dimen) such as 10pt cannot contain a plus or minus component.  A rubber length (what Plain TeX calls a skip) can contain those, as with 1cm plus0.05cm minus0.01cm.  These give the ability to stretch or shrink; the length in the prior sentence could appear in the output as long as 1.05cm or as short as 0.99cm, depending on what TeXs typesetting algorithm finds optimum.  The plus or minus component of a rubber length can contain a fill component, as in 1in plus2fill.  This gives the length infinite stretchability or shrinkability, so that the length in the prior sentence can be set by TeX to any distance greater than or equal to 1inch.  TeX actually provides three infinite glue components fil, fill, and filll, such that the later ones overcome the earlier ones, but only the middle value is ordinarily used.  See \hfill, See \vfill.  Multiplying an entire rubber length by a number turns it into a rigid length, so that after \setlength{\ylength}{1in plus 0.2in} and \setlength{\zlength}{3\ylength} then the value of \zlength is 3in.     Units of length:The units that LaTeX knows.   \setlength:Set the value of a length.   \addtolength:Add a quantity to a length.   \settodepth:Set a length to the depth of something.   \settoheight:Set a length to the height of something.   \settowidth:Set a length to the width of something.   Predefined lengths:Lengths that are, like, predefined.
