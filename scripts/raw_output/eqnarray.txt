             First, a caveat: the eqnarray environment is depreciated.  It has infelicities that cannot be overcome, including spacing that is inconsistent with other mathematics elements (see the article Avoid eqnarray! by Lars Madsen http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb33-1/tb103madsen.pdf).  New documents should include the amsmath package and use the displayed mathematics environments provided there, such as the align environment.  Nevertheless, for completeness and for a reference when working with old documents, a synopsis:   \begin{eqnarray}    first formula left  &first formula middle  &first formula right \\   ... \end{eqnarray}   or    \begin{eqnarray*}    first formula left  &first formula middle  &first formula right \\   ... \end{eqnarray*}    Display a sequence of equations or inequalities.  The left and right sides are typeset in display mode, while the middle is typeset in text mode.  It is similar to a three-column array environment, with items within a row separated by an ampersand(&), and with rows separated by double backslash \\).  The starred form of line break (\\*) can also be used to separate equations, and will disallow a page break there (see \\).    The unstarred form eqnarray places an equation number on every line (using the equation counter), unless that line contains a \nonumber command.  The starred form eqnarray* omits equation numbering, while otherwise being the same.   The command \lefteqn is used for splitting long formulas across lines. It typesets its argument in display style flush left in a box of zero width.  This example shows three lines.  The first two lines make an inequality, while the third line has not entry on the left side.   \begin{eqnarray*}   \lefteqn{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}     \\     &\leq &y_1+y_2+\cdots+y_n      \\     &=    &z+y_3+\cdots+y_n \end{eqnarray*}
