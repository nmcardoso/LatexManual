       Synopsis:    \address{senders address}   Specifies the return address as it appears on the letter and on the envelope.  Separate multiple lines in senders address with a double backslash\\.  Because it can apply to multiple letters this declaration is often put in the preamble.  However, it can go anywhere, including inside an individual letter environment.  This command is optional: without the \address declaration the letter is formatted with some blank space on top, for copying onto pre-printed letterhead paper.  (See Overview, for details on your local implementation.)  With the \address declaration, it is formatted as a personal letter.  Here is an example.   \address{Stephen Maturin \\          The Grapes of the Savoy}
