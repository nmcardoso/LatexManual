          Synopsis:   \begin{description} \item [first label] text of first item \item [second label] text of second item   ... \end{description}   Environment to make a labelled list of items.  Each items label is typeset in bold, flush-left.  Each items text may contain multiple paragraphs.  Although the labels on the items are optional there is no sensible default, so all items should have labels.   The list consists of at least one item, created with the \item command (see \item).  Having no items causes the LaTeX error Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item).    Since the labels are in bold style, if the label text calls for a font change given in argument style (see Font styles) then it will come out bold.  For instance, if the label text calls for typewriter with \item[\texttt{label text}] then it will appear in bold typewriter, if that is available. The simplest way to get non-bold typewriter is to use declarative style: \item[{\tt label text}].  Similarly, to get the standard roman font, use \item[{\rm label text}].  For other major LaTeX labelled list environments, see itemize and enumerate.  For information about customizing list layout, see list; also, the package enumitem is useful for this.  This example shows the environment used for a sequence of definitions.   \begin{definition}   \item[lama] A priest.   \item[llama] A beast. \end{definition}
