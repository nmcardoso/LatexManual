        The \- command tells LaTeX that it may hyphenate the word at that point.  LaTeX is pretty good at hyphenating, and usually finds most of the correct hyphenation points, while almost never using an incorrect one.  The \- command is used for the exceptional cases.  When you insert \- commands in a word, the word will only be hyphenated at those points and not at any of the hyphenation points that LaTeX might otherwise have chosen.
