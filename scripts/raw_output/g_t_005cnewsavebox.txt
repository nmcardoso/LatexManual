        Allocate a bin for holding a box.  Synopsis:   \newsavebox{\cmd}   Defines \cmd to refer to a new bin for storing boxes. Such a box is for holding typeset material, to use multiple times (see Boxes) or to measure or manipulate.  The name \cmd must start with a backslash (\), and must not be already defined.  The allocation of a box is global.  This command is fragile (see \protect).
