         The following type style commands are supported by LaTeX.  This first group of commands is typically used with an argument, as in \textit{text}.  In the table below, the corresponding command in parenthesis is the declaration form, which takes no arguments, as in {\itshape text}.  The scope of the declaration form lasts until the next type style command or the end of the current group.  These commands, in both the argument form and the declaration form, are cumulative; e.g., you can say either \sffamily\bfseries or \bfseries\sffamily to get bold sans serif.  You can alternatively use an environment form of the declarations; for instance, \begin{ttfamily}...\end{ttfamily}.    These font-switching commands automatically insert italic corrections if needed.  (See \/, for the details of italic corrections.) Specifically, they insert the italic correction unless the following character is in the list \nocorrlist, which by default consists of a period and a comma.  To suppress the automatic insertion of italic correction, use \nocorr at the start or end of the command argument, such as \textit{\nocorr text} or \textsc{text \nocorr}.   \textrm (\rmfamily)   Roman.   \textit (\itshape)   Italics.   \textmd (\mdseries)   Medium weight (default).   \textbf (\bfseries)   Boldface.   \textup (\upshape)   Upright (default).   \textsl (\slshape)   Slanted.   \textsf (\sffamily)   Sans serif.   \textsc (\scshape)   Small caps.   \texttt (\ttfamily)   Typewriter.   \textnormal (\normalfont)   Main document font.       Although it also changes fonts, the \emph{text} command is semantic, for text to be emphasized, and should not be used as a substitute for \textit.  For example, \emph{start text \emph{middle text} end text} will result in the start text and end text in italics, but middle text will be in roman.  LaTeX also provides the following commands, which unconditionally switch to the given style, that is, are not cumulative.  Also, they are used differently than the above commands: {\cmd...} instead of \cmd{...}.  These are two unrelated constructs.   \bf    Switch to bold face.   \cal     Switch to calligraphic letters for math.   \it    Italics.   \rm    Roman.   \sc    Small caps.   \sf    Sans serif.   \sl     Slanted (oblique).   \tt      Typewriter (monospace, fixed-width).     The \em command is the unconditional version of \emph.  (Some people consider the unconditional font-switching commands, such as \tt, obsolete and that only the cumulative commands (\texttt) should be used.  Others think that both sets of commands have their place and sometimes an unconditional font switch is precisely what you want; for one example, see description.)  The following commands are for use in math mode.  They are not cumulative, so \mathbf{\mathit{symbol}} does not create a boldface and italic symbol; instead, it will just be in italics.  This is because typically math symbols need consistent typographic treatment, regardless of the surrounding environment.   \mathrm  Roman, for use in math mode.   \mathbf  Boldface, for use in math mode.   \mathsf  Sans serif, for use in math mode.   \mathtt  Typewriter, for use in math mode.   \mathit (\mit) Italics, for use in math mode.   \mathnormal  For use in math mode, e.g., inside another type style declaration.   \mathcal  Calligraphic letters, for use in math mode.        In addition, the command \mathversion{bold} can be used for switching to bold letters and symbols in formulas. \mathversion{normal} restores the default.       Finally, the command \oldstylenums{numerals} will typeset so-called old-style numerals, which have differing heights and depths (and sometimes widths) from the standard lining numerals, which all have the same height as upper-case letters.  LaTeXs default fonts support this, and will respect \textbf (but not other styles; there are no italic old-style numerals in Computer Modern).  Many other fonts have old-style numerals also; sometimes the textcomp package must be loaded, and sometimes package options are provided to make them the default.
