          Defines a command, as long as no command of this name already exists. Synopses:   \providecommand{cmd}[nargs][optargdefault]{defn} \providecommand*{cmd}[nargs][optargdefault]{defn}   If no command of this name already exists then this has the same effect as \newcommand (see \newcommand & \renewcommand).  If a command of this name already exists then this definition does nothing. This is particularly useful in a style file, or other file that may be loaded more than once.
