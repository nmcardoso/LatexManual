         You can access any character of the current font using its number with the \symbol command. For example, the visible space character used in the \verb* command has the code decimal 32, so it can be typed as \symbol{32}.  You can also specify numbers in octal (base 8) by using a ' prefix, or hexadecimal (base 16) with a " prefix, so the previous example could also be written as \symbol{'40} or \symbol{"20}.
