         Synopsis:   \begin{center}   ... text ... \end{center}   Create a new paragraph consisting of a sequence of lines that are centered within the left and right margins on the current page.  Use double-backslash to get a line break at a particular spot (see \\).  If some text environment body is too long to fit on a line, LaTeX will insert line breaks that avoid hyphenation and avoid stretching or shrinking any interword space.  This environment inserts space above and below the text body.  See \centering to avoid such space, for example inside a figure environment.  This example produces three centered lines.  There is extra vertical space between the last two lines.   \begin{center}   A Thesis Submitted in Partial Fufillment \\   of the Requirements of \\[0.5ex]   the School of Environmental Engineering \end{center}   In this example, depending on the pages line width, LaTeX may choose a line break for the part before the double backslash.  If so, it will center each of the two lines and if not it will center the single line. Then LaTeX will break at the double backslash, and will center the ending.   \begin{center}   My father considered that anyone who went to chapel and didn't drink    alcohol was not to be tolerated.\\    I grew up in that belief.  --Richard Burton  \end{center}   A double backslash after the final line is optional.    \centering:Declaration form of the center environment.
