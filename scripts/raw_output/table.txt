          Synopsis:   \begin{table}[placement]   table body \caption[loftitle]{title} \label{label} \end{table}   A class of floats (see Floats).  Because they cannot be split across pages, they are not typeset in sequence with the normal text but instead are floated to a convenient place, such as the top of a following page.  For the possible values of placement and their effect on the  float placement algorithm, see Floats.  The table body is typeset in a parbox of width \textwidth and so it can contain text, commands, etc.  The label is optional; it is used for cross references (see Cross references).    The optional \caption command specifies caption text for the table.  By default it is numbered.  If lottitle is present, it is used in the list of tables instead of title (see Tables of contents).  In this example the table and caption will float to the bottom of a page, unless it is pushed to a float page at the end.   \begin{table}[b]   \centering   \begin{tabular}{r|p{2in}} \hline     One &The loneliest number \\     Two &Can be as sad as one.          It's the loneliest number since the number one.   \end{tabular}   \caption{Cardinal virtues}   \label{tab:CardinalVirtues} \end{table}
