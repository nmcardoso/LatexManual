         Synopsis:   \usecounter{counter}   In the list environment, when used in the second argument, this command sets up counter to number the list items.  It initializes counter to zero, and arranges that when \item is called without its optional argument then counter is incremented by \refstepcounter, making its value be the current ref value.  This command is fragile (see \protect).  Put in the preamble, this makes a new list environment enumerated with testcounter:   \newcounter{testcounter} \newenvironment{test}{%   \begin{list}{}{%     \usecounter{testcounter}   } }{%   \end{list} }
