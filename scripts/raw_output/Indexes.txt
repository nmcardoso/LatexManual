        The command \makeindex enables creating indexes.  Put this in the preamble.    The command \index{text} writes an index entry for text to an auxiliary file named with the .idx extension.   Specifically, what gets written is the command \indexentry{text}{pageno}, where pageno is the current \thepage value.    To generate a index entry for bar that says See foo, use a vertical bar: \index{bar|see{foo}}.  Use seealso instead of see to make a See also entry.    The text See is defined by the macro \seename, and See also by the macro \alsoname.  These can be redefined for other languages.     The generated .idx file is then sorted with an external command, usually either makeindex (http://mirror.ctan.org/indexing/makeindex) or (the multi-lingual) xindy (http://xindy.sourceforge.net). This results in a .ind file, which can then be read to typeset the index.    The index is usually generated with the \printindex command. This is defined in the makeidx package, so \usepackage{makeidx} needs to be in the preamble.   The rubber length \indexspace is inserted before each new letter in the printed index; its default value is 10pt plus5pt minus3pt.   The showidx package causes each index entries to be shown in the margin on the page where the entry appears.  This can help in preparing the index.   The multind package supports multiple indexes.
