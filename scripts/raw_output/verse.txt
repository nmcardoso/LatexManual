         Synopsis:   \begin{verse} line1 \\ line2 \\ ... \end{verse}   The verse environment is designed for poetry, though you may find other uses for it.   The margins are indented on the left and the right, paragraphs are not indented, and the text is not justified.  Separate the lines of each stanza with \\, and use one or more blank lines to separate the stanzas.
