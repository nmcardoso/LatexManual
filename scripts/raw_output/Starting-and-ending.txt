         LaTeX files have a simple global structure, with a standard beginning and ending.  Here is a hello, world example:   \documentclass{article} \begin{document} Hello, \LaTeX\ world. \end{document}    Here, the article is the so-called document class, implemented in a file article.cls.  Any document class can be used.  A few document classes are defined by LaTeX itself, and vast array of others are widely available.  See Document classes.   You can include other LaTeX commands between the \documentclass and the \begin{document} commands. This area is called the preamble.  The \begin{document} ... \end{document} is a so-called  environment; the document environment (and no others) is required in all LaTeX documents (see document).  LaTeX provides many environments itself, and many more are defined separately. See Environments.  The following sections discuss how to produce PDF or other output from a LaTeX input file.
