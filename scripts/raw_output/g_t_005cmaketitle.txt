        The \maketitle command generates a title on a separate title pageexcept in the article class, where the title is placed at the top of the first page.  Information used to produce the title is obtained from the following declarations:   \author{name \and name2}      The \author command declares the document author(s), where the argument is a list of authors separated by \and commands.  Use \\ to separate lines within a single authors entryfor example, to give the authors institution or address.   \date{text}    The \date command declares text to be the documents date.  With no \date command, the current date (see \today) is used.   \thanks{text}     The \thanks command produces a \footnote to the title, usually used for credit acknowledgements.   \title{text}     The \title command declares text to be the title of the document.  Use \\ to force a line break, as usual.
