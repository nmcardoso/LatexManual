         LaTeX sets aside the following characters for special purposes (for example, the percent sign% is for comments) so they are called reserved characters or special characters.   # $ % & { } _ ~ ^ \           If you want a reserved character to be printed as itself, in the text body font, for all but the final three characters in that list simply put a backslash\ in front of the character.  Thus, \$1.23 will produce$1.23 in your output.     As to the last three characters, to get a tilde in the text body font use \~{} (omitting the curly braces would result in the next character receiving a tilde accent).  Similarly, to get a get a text body font circumflex use \^{}.  A text body font backslash results from \textbackslash{}.  To produce the reserved characters in a typewriter font use \verb!!, as below.   \begin{center}   \# \$ \% \& \{ \} \_ \~{} \^{} \textbackslash \\   \verb!# $ % & { } _ ~ ^ \! \end{center}   In that example the double backslash\\ is only there to split the lines.
