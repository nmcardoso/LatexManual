        The \today command produces todays date, in the format month dd, yyyy; for example, July 4, 1976. It uses the predefined counters \day, \month, and \year (see \day \month \year) to do this.  It is not updated as the program runs.  Multilingual packages like babel or classes like lettre, among others, will localize \today. For example, the following will output 4 juillet 1976:   \year=1976 \month=7 \day=4 \documentclass{minimal} \usepackage[french]{babel} \begin{document} \today \end{document}    The datetime package, among others, can produce a wide variety of other date formats.
