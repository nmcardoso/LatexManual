         \newfont, now obsolete, defines a command that will switch fonts. Synopsis:   \newfont{\cmd}{font description}   This defines a control sequence \cmd that will change the current font.  LaTeX will look on your system for a file named fontname.tfm.  The control sequence must must not already be defined.  It must begin with a backslash (\).   This command is obsolete.  It is a low-level command for setting up an individual font.  Today fonts are almost always defined in families (which allows you to, for example, associate a boldface with a roman) through the so-called New Font Selection Scheme, either by using .fd files or through the use of an engine that can access system fonts such as XeLaTeX (see TeX engines).    But since it is part of LaTeX, here is an explanation: the font description consists of a fontname and an optional at clause; this can have the form either at dimen or scaled factor, where a factor of 1000 means no scaling.  For LaTeXs purposes, all this does is scale all the character and other font dimensions relative to the fonts design size, which is a value defined in the .tfm file.  This example defines two equivalent fonts and typesets a few characters in each:   \newfont{\testfontat}{cmb10 at 11pt} \newfont{\testfontscaled}{cmb10 scaled 1100} \testfontat abc \testfontscaled abc
