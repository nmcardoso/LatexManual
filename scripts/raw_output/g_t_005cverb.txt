        Synopsis:   \verbcharliteral-textchar \verb*charliteral-textchar   The \verb command typesets literal-text as it is input, including special characters and spaces, using the typewriter (\tt) font.  No spaces are allowed between \verb or \verb* and the delimiter char, which begins and ends the verbatim text.  The delimiter must not appear in literal-text.   The *-form differs only in that spaces are printed with a visible space character.
