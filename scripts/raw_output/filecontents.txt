            Synopsis:   \begin{filecontents}{filename}   text \end{filecontents}   or   \begin{filecontents*}{filename}   text \end{filecontents*}   Create a file named filename and fill it with text.  The unstarred version of the environment filecontents prefixes the content of the created file with a header; see the example below.  The starred version filecontents* does not include the header.  This environment can be used anywhere in the preamble, although it often appears before the \documentclass command.  It is typically used when a source file requires a nonstandard style or class file.  The environment will write that file to the directory containing the source and thus make the source file self-contained.  Another use is to include bib references in the file, again to make it self-contained.  The environment checks whether a file of that name already exists and if so, does not do anything.  There is a filecontents package that redefines the filecontents environment so that instead of doing nothing in that case, it will overwrite the existing file.  For example, this document   \documentclass{article} \begin{filecontents}{JH.sty} \newcommand{\myname}{Jim Hef{}feron} \end{filecontents} \usepackage{JH} \begin{document} Article by \myname. \end{document}   produces this file JH.sty.   %% LaTeX2e file `JH.sty' %% generated by the `filecontents' environment %% from source `test' on 2015/10/12. %% \newcommand{\myname}{Jim Hef{}feron}
