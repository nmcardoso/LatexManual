        In a math environment, LaTeX ignores the spaces that you use in the source, and instead puts in the spacing according to the normal rules for mathematics texts.    Many math mode spacing definitions are expressed in terms of the math unit mu given by 1 em = 18 mu, where the em is taken from the current math symbols family (see Units of length). LaTeX provides the following commands for use in math mode:   \;   Normally 5.0mu plus 5.0mu.  The longer name is \thickspace.  Math mode only.   \: \>    Normally 4.0mu plus 2.0mu minus 4.0mu.  The longer name is \medspace.  Math mode only.   \,   Normally 3mu.  The longer name is \thinspace.  This can be used in both math mode and text mode. See \thinspace.   \!  A negative thin space. Normally -3mu.  Math mode only.   \quad   This is 18mu, that is, 1em. This is often used for space surrounding equations or expressions, for instance for the space between two equations inside a displaymath environment.  It is available in both text and math mode.   \qquad  A length of 2 quads, that is, 36mu = 2em.  It is available in both text and math mode.    In this example a thinspace separates the function from the infinitesimal.   \int_0^1 f(x)\,dx
