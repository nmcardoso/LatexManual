         Synopsis:   \begin{array}{cols}   column 1 entry &column 2 entry ... &column n entry \\   ... \end{array}   or   \begin{array}[pos]{cols}   column 1 entry &column 2 entry ... &column n entry \\   ... \end{array}   Produce a mathematical array.  This environment can only be used in math mode, and normally appears within a displayed mathematics environment such as equation (see equation).  Column entries are separated by an ampersand(&).  Rows are terminated with double-backslashes (see \\).    The required argument cols describes the number of columns, their alignment, and the formatting of the intercolumn regions.  See tabular for the complete description of cols, and of the other common features of the two environments, including the optional pos argument.  There are two ways that array diverges from tabular.  The first is that array entries are typeset in math mode, in textstyle (except if the cols definition specifies the column with p{...}, which causes the entry to be typeset in text mode). The second is that, instead of tabulars parameter \tabcolsep, LaTeXs intercolumn space in an array is governed by  \arraycolsep, which gives half the width between columns. The default for this is 5pt.  To obtain arrays with braces the standard is to use the amsmath package.  It comes with environments pmatrix for an array surrounded by parentheses(...), bmatrix for an array surrounded by square brackets[...], Bmatrix for an array surrounded by curly braces{...}, vmatrix for an array surrounded by vertical bars|...|, and Vmatrix for an array surrounded by double vertical bars||...||, along with a number of other array constructs.  Here is an example of an array:   \begin{equation}   \begin{array}{cr}     \sqrt{y}  &12.3 \\     x^2       &3.4          \end{array} \end{equation}   The next example works if \usepackage{amsmath} is in the preamble:   \begin{equation}   \begin{vmatrix}{cc}     a  &b \\     c  &d          \end{vmatrix}=ad-bc \end{equation}
