         Synopsis:   \begin{thebibliography}{widest-label} \bibitem[label]{cite_key} ... \end{thebibliography}   The thebibliography environment produces a bibliography or reference list.  In the article class, this reference list is labelled References; in the report class, it is labelled Bibliography.  You can change the label (in the standard classes) by redefining the command \refname.  For instance, this eliminates it entirely:   \renewcommand{\refname}{}   The mandatory widest-label argument is text that, when typeset, is as wide as the widest item label produced by the \bibitem commands.  It is typically given as 9 for bibliographies with less than 10 references, 99 for ones with less than 100, etc.    \bibitem:Specify a bibliography item.   \cite:Refer to a bibliography item.   \nocite:Include an item in the bibliography.   Using BibTeX:Automatic generation of bibliographies.
