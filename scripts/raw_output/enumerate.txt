         Synopsis:   \begin{enumerate} \item [first label] text of first item \item [second label] text of second item ... \end{enumerate}   Environment to produce a numbered list of items.  The format of the label numbering depends on whether this environment is nested within another; see below.   The list consists of at least one item.  Having no items causes the LaTeX error Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item.  Each item is produced with an \item command.  This example lists the top two finishers in the 1908 Olympic marathon.   \begin{enumerate}  \item Johnny Hayes (USA)  \item Charles Hefferon (RSA)  \end{enumerate}   Enumerations may be nested within a paragraph-making environment, including itemize (see itemize), description (see description) and enumeration, up to four levels deep. The format of the label produced depends on the place in the nesting. This gives LaTeXs default for the format at each nesting level (where 1 is the outermost level):    arabic number followed by a period: 1., 2.,  lower case letter inside parentheses: (a), (b)  lower case roman numeral followed by a period: i., ii.,  upper case letter followed by a period: A., B.,       The enumerate environment uses the counters \enumi through \enumiv counters (see Counters).  If you use the optional argument to \item then the counter is not incremented for that item (see \item).      To change the format of the label use \renewcommand (see \newcommand & \renewcommand) on the commands \labelenumi through \labelenumiv. For instance, this first level list will be labelled with uppercase letters, in boldface, and without a trailing period:    \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\textbf{\Alph{enumi}}} \begin{enumerate}   \item eI   \item bi:   \item si: \end{enumerate}   For a list of counter-labelling commands like \Alph see \alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman \fnsymbol.  For more on customizing the layout see list.  Also, the package enumitem is useful for this.
