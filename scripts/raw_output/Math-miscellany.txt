        \*     A discretionary multiplication symbol, at which a line break is allowed. Without the break multiplication is implicitly indicated by a space, while in the case of a break a  symbol is printed immediately before the break. So   \documentclass{article} \begin{document} Now \(A_3 = 0\), hence the product of all terms \(A_1\)  through \(A_4\), that is \(A_1\* A_2\* A_3 \* A_4\), is  equal to zero. \end{document}   will make that sort of output(the ellipsis [] is here to show the line break at the same place as in a TeX output):   Now A_3 = 0, [] A_1 through A_4, that is A_1 A_2 \timesA_3 A_4, is equal to zero.    \cdots   A horizontal ellipsis with the dots raised to the center of the line.   \ddots   A diagonal ellipsis: \ddots.   \frac{num}{den}    Produces the fraction num divided by den.    \left delim1 ... \right delim2     The two delimiters need not match; . acts as a null delimiter, producing no output.  The delimiters are sized according to the math in between.  Example: \left( \sum_{i=1}^{10} a_i \right].   \mathdollar   Dollar sign in math mode: $.   \mathellipsis   Ellipsis (spaced for text) in math mode: .   \mathparagraph   Paragraph sign (pilcrow) in math mode: .   \mathsection   Section sign in math mode.   \mathsterling   Sterling sign in math mode: .   \mathunderscore   Underscore in math mode: _.   \overbrace{text}   Generates a brace over text. For example, \overbrace{x+\cdots+x}^{k \;\textrm{times}}.           \overline{text}   Generates a horizontal line over tex. For example, \overline{x+y}.   \sqrt[root]{arg}   Produces the representation of the square root of arg.  The optional argument root determines what root to produce.  For example, the cube root of x+y would be typed as \sqrt[3]{x+y}.   \stackrel{text}{relation}   Puts text above relation.  For example, \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}.   \underbrace{math}   Generates math with a brace underneath. For example, \underbrace{x+y+z}_{>\,0}   \underline{text}   Causes text, which may be either math mode or not, to be underlined.  The line is always below the text, taking account of descenders.   \vdots   Produces a vertical ellipsis.
