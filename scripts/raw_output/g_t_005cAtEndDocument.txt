       Synopsis:   \AtEndDocument{code}   Save code and execute it near the end of the document. Specifically, it is executed when \end{document} is executed, before the final page is finished and before any leftover floating environments are processed. If you want some of the code to be executed after these two processes then include a \clearpage at the appropriate point in code.  You can issue this command more than once; the successive code lines will be executed in the order that you gave them.
