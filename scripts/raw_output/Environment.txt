    Synopsis:   \begin{environment name}   ... \end{environment name}   An area of LaTeX source, inside of which there is a distinct behavior.  For instance, for poetry in LaTeX put the lines between \begin{verse} and \end{verse}.   \begin{verse}   There once was a man from Nantucket \\   ... \end{verse}   SeeEnvironments for a list of environments.   The environment name at the beginning must exactly match that at the end.  This includes the case where environment name ends in a star(*); both the \begin and \end texts must include the star.  Environments may have arguments, including optional arguments.  This example produces a table.  The first argument is optional (and causes the table to be aligned on its top row) while the second argument is required (it specifies the formatting of columns).   \begin{tabular}[t]{r|l}   ... rows of table ... \end{tabular}
