          Synopsis:   \pagestyle{style}   The \pagestyle command specifies how the headers and footers are typeset from the current page onwards.  Values for style:   plain Just a plain page number.   empty Empty headers and footers, e.g., no page numbers.   headings Put running headers on each page.  The document style specifies what goes in the headers.   myheadings Custom headers, specified via the \markboth or the \markright commands.     Here are the descriptions of \markboth and \markright:   \markboth{left}{right}   Sets both the left and the right heading.  A left-hand heading (left) is generated by the last \markboth command before the end of the page, while a right-hand heading (right) is generated by the first \markboth or \markright that comes on the page if there is one, otherwise by the last one before the page.   \markright{right}   Sets the right heading, leaving the left heading unchanged.
