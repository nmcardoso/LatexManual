       Draws a horizontal line the width of the enclosing tabular or array environment.  Its most commonly used to draw a line at the top, bottom, and between the rows of a table.  In this example the top of the table has two horizontal rules, one above the other, that span both columns.  The bottom of the table has a single rule spanning both columns.  Because of the \hline, the tabular second rows line ending double backslash\\ is required.   \begin{tabular}{ll} \hline\hline   Baseball   &Red Sox  \\   Basketball &Celtics  \\ \hline \end{tabular}
