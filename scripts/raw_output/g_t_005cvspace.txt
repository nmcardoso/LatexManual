         Synopsis, one of these two:   \vspace{length} \vspace*{length}   Add the vertical space length.  This can be negative or positive, and is a rubber length (see Lengths).  LaTeX removes the vertical space from \vspace at a page break, that is, at the top or bottom of a page.  The starred version \vspace*{...} causes the space to stay.  If \vspace is used in the middle of a paragraph (i.e., in horizontal mode), the space is inserted after the line with the \vspace command.  A new paragraph is not started.  In this example the two questions will be evenly spaced vertically on the page, with at least one inch of space below each.   \begin{document} 1) Who put the bomp in the bomp bah bomp bah bomp? \vspace{1in plus 1fill}  2) Who put the ram in the rama lama ding dong? \vspace{1in plus 1fill} \end{document}
