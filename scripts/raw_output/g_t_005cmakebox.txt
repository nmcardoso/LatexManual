       Synopsis:   \makebox[width][position]{text}   The \makebox command creates a box just wide enough to contain the text specified.  The width of the box can be overridden by the optional width argument.  The position of the text within the box is determined by the optional position argument, which may take the following values:   c Centered (default).  l Flush left.  r Flush right.  s Stretch (justify) across entire width; text must contain stretchable space for this to work.    \makebox is also used within the picture environment see \makebox (picture).
