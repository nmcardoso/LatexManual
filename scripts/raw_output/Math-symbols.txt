         LaTeX provides almost any mathematical symbol youre likely to need. For example, if you include $\pi$ in your source, you will get the pi symbol .   Below is a list of commonly-available symbols.  It is by no means an exhaustive list.  Each symbol here is described with a short phrase, and its symbol class (which determines the spacing around it) is given in parenthesis.  Unless said otherwise, the commands for these symbols can be used only in math mode.

Similar: \vert and| produce the same single-line vertical bar symbol but without any spacing (they fall in class ordinary) and you should not use them as relations but instead only as ordinals, i.e., footnote symbols.
