           Allocate a new length register.  Synopsis:   \newlength{\arg}   This command takes one required argument, which must begin with a backslash (\).  It creates a new length register named \arg, which is a place to hold (rubber) lengths such as 1in plus.2in minus.1in (what plain TeX calls a skip register).  The register gets an initial value of zero.  The control sequence \arg must not already be defined.  See Lengths, for more about lengths.
