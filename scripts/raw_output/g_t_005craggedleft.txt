          The \raggedleft declaration corresponds to the flushright environment.  This declaration can be used inside an environment such as quote or in a parbox.  Unlike the flushright environment, the \raggedleft command does not start a new paragraph; it only changes how LaTeX formats paragraph units.  To affect a paragraph units format, the scope of the declaration must contain the blank line or \end command that ends the paragraph unit.
