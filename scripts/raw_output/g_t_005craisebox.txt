       Synopsis:   \raisebox{distance}[height][depth]{text}   The \raisebox command raises or lowers text.  The first mandatory argument specifies how high text is to be raised (or lowered if it is a negative amount).  text itself is processed in LR mode.  The optional arguments height and depth are dimensions.  If they are specified, LaTeX treats text as extending a certain distance above the baseline (height) or below (depth), ignoring its natural height and depth.
