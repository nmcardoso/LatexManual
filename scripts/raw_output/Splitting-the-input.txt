        A large document requires a lot of input.  Rather than putting the whole input in a single large file, its more efficient to split it into several smaller ones.  Regardless of how many separate files you use, there is one that is the    root file; it is the one whose name you type when you run LaTeX.  See filecontents, for an environment that allows bundling an external file to be created with the main document.    \include:Conditionally include a file.   \includeonly:Determine which files are included.   \input:Unconditionally include a file.
