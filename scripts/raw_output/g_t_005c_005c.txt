         Synopsis:   \\[morespace]   or    \\*[morespace]   Start a new line.  The optional argument morespace specifies extra vertical space to be insert before the next line.  This can be a negative length.  The text before the break is set at its normal length, that is, it is not stretched to fill out the line width.  Explicit line breaks in the text body are unusual in LaTeX.  In particular, to start a new paragraph instead leave a blank line.  This command is mostly used outside of the main flow of text such as in a tabular or array environment.  Under ordinary circumstances (e.g., outside of a p{...} column in a tabular environment) the \newline command is a synonym for \\ (see \newline).  In addition to starting a new line, the starred form \\* tells LaTeX not to start a new page between the two lines, by issuing a \nobreak.   \title{My story: \\[0.25in]        a tale of woe}
