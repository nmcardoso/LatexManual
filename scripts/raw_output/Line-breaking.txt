        The first thing LaTeX does when processing ordinary text is to translate your input file into a sequence of glyphs and spaces.  To produce a printed document, this sequence must be broken into lines (and these lines must be broken into pages).  LaTeX usually does the line (and page) breaking in the text body for you but in some environments you manually force line breaks.    \\:Start a new line.   \obeycr & \restorecr:Make each input line start a new output line.   \newline:Break the line   \- (hyphenation):Insert explicit hyphenation.   \discretionary:Insert explicit hyphenation with control of hyphen character.   \fussy:Be fussy about line breaking.   \sloppy:Be sloppy about line breaking.   \hyphenation:Tell LaTeX how to hyphenate a word.   \linebreak & \nolinebreak:Forcing & avoiding line breaks.
