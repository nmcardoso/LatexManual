       Synopsis:   \parbox[position][height][inner-pos]{width}{text}   The \parbox command produces a box whose contents are created in paragraph mode.  It should be used to make a box small pieces of text, with nothing fancy inside.  In particular, you shouldnt use any paragraph-making environments inside a \parbox argument.  For larger pieces of text, including ones containing a paragraph-making environment, you should use a minipage environment (see minipage).  \parbox has two mandatory arguments:   width the width of the parbox;  text the text that goes inside the parbox.    By default LaTeX will position vertically a parbox so its center lines up with the center of the surrounding text line.  When the optional position argument is present and equal either to t or b, this allows you respectively to align either the top or bottom line in the parbox with the baseline of the surrounding text. You may also specify m for position to get the default behaviour.  The optional height argument overrides the natural height of the box.  The inner-pos argument controls the placement of the text inside the box, as follows; if it is not specified, position is used.   t text is placed at the top of the box.  c text is centered in the box.  b text is placed at the bottom of the box.  s stretch vertically; the text must contain vertically stretchable space for this to work.
