          You can specify so-called global options or class options to the \documentclass command by enclosing them in square brackets. To specify more than one option, separate them with a comma, as in:   \documentclass[option1,option2,...]{class}   Here is the list of the standard class options.     All of the standard classes except slides accept the following options for selecting the typeface size (default is 10pt):   10pt  11pt  12pt         All of the standard classes accept these options for selecting the paper size (these show height by width):   a4paper 210 by 297 mm (about 8.25 by 11.75 inches)   a5paper 148 by 210 mm (about 5.8 by 8.3 inches)   b5paper 176 by 250 mm (about 6.9 by 9.8 inches)    executivepaper 7.25 by 10.5 inches    legalpaper 8.5 by 14 inches    letterpaper 8.5 by 11 inches (the default)       When using one of the engines pdfLaTeX, LuaLaTeX, or XeLaTeX (see TeX engines), options other than letterpaper set the print area but you must also set the physical paper size.  One way to do that is to put \pdfpagewidth=\paperwidth and \pdfpageheight=\paperheight in your documents preamble.  The geometry package provides flexible ways of setting the print area and physical page size.          Miscellaneous other options:   draft final  Mark (draft) or do not mark (final) overfull boxes with a black box in the margin; default is final.   fleqn    Put displayed formulas flush left; default is centered.   landscape   Selects landscape format; default is portrait.   leqno    Put equation numbers on the left side of equations; default is the right side.   openbib  Use open bibliography format.   titlepage notitlepage  Specifies whether there is a separate page for the title information and for the abstract also, if there is one.  The default for the report class is titlepage, for the other classes it is notitlepage.    The following options are not available with the slides class.         onecolumn twocolumn Typeset in one or two columns; default is onecolumn.   oneside twoside   Selects one- or two-sided layout; default is oneside, except that in the book class the default is twoside.  For one-sided printing, the text is centered on the page.  For two-sided printing, the \evensidemargin (\oddsidemargin) parameter determines the distance on even (odd) numbered pages between the left side of the page and the texts left margin, with \oddsidemargin being 40% of the difference between \paperwidth and \textwidth, and \evensidemargin is the remainder.   openright openany Determines if a chapter should start on a right-hand page; default is openright for book, and openany for report.     The slides class offers the option clock for printing the time at the bottom of each note.      Additional packages pkg are loaded like this:   \usepackage[options]{pkg}   To specify more than one package, you can separate them with a comma, as in \usepackage{pkg1,pkg2,...}, or use multiple \usepackage commands.    Any options given in the \documentclass command that are unknown by the selected document class are passed on to the packages loaded with \usepackage.
