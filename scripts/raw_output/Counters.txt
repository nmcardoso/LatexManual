        Everything LaTeX numbers for you has a counter associated with it. The name of the counter is often the same as the name of the environment or command associated with the number, except that the counters name has no backslash\.  Thus, associated with the \chapter command is the chapter counter that keeps track of the chapter number.    Below is a list of the counters used in LaTeXs standard document classes to control numbering.   part            paragraph       figure          enumi chapter         subparagraph    table           enumii section         page            footnote        enumiii subsection      equation        mpfootnote      enumiv subsubsection   The mpfootnote counter is used by the \footnote command inside of a minipage (see minipage).
