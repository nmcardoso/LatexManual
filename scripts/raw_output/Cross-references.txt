       One reason for numbering things such as figures and equations is to refer the reader to them, as in See Figure~3 for more details.  Including the figure number in the source is poor practice since if that number changes as the document evolves then you must remember to update this reference by hand. Instead, LaTeX has you write something like \label{eq:GreensThm} and refer to it with See equation~\ref{eq:GreensThm}.  LaTeX writes the information from the labels to a file with the same name as the file containing the \label{...} but with an .aux extension.  (The information has the format \newlabel{label}{{currentlabel}{pagenumber}} where currentlabel is the current value of the macro \@currentlabel that is usually updated whenever you call \refstepcounter{counter}.)    The most common side effect of the prior paragraph happens when your document has a forward reference, a \ref{key} that appears earlier than the associated \label{key}; see the example in the \pageref{...} description.  LaTeX gets the information for references from the .aux file.  If this is the first time you are running the document then you will get a message LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross references right. and in the output the reference will appear as two question marks??, in boldface.  Or, if you change some things so the references change then you get the same warning and the output contains the old reference information.  The solution in either case is just to compile the document a second time.    \label:Assign a symbolic name to a piece of text.   \pageref:Refer to a page number.   \ref:Refer to a section, figure or similar.
