          Synopses:   \linebreak[priority] \nolinebreak[priority]   By default, the \linebreak (\nolinebreak) command forces (prevents) a line break at the current position.  For \linebreak, the spaces in the line are stretched out so that it extends to the right margin as usual.  With the optional argument priority, you can convert the command from a demand to a request.  The priority must be a number from 0 to4.  The higher the number, the more insistent the request.
