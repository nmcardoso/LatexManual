       Inside a table environment the \footnote command does not work.  For instance, if the code below appears on its own then the footnote simply disappears; there is a footnote mark in the table cell but nothing is set at the bottom of the page.   \begin{center}      \begin{tabular}{l|l}      \textsc{Ship}  &\textsc{Book} \\ \hline       \textit{HMS Sophie}     &Master and Commander  \\       \textit{HMS Polychrest} &Post Captain  \\        \textit{HMS Lively}     &Post Captain \\      \textit{HMS Surprise}   &A number of books\footnote{Starting with HMS Surprise.}      \end{tabular} \end{center}   The solution is to surround the tabular environment with a minipage environment, as here (see minipage).   \begin{center}   \begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}     ... tabular material ...   \end{minipage} \end{center}   The same technique will work inside a floating table environment (see table).  To get the footnote at the bottom of the page use the tablefootnote package, as illustrated in this example.  If you put \usepackage{tablefootnote} in the preamble and use the code shown then the footnote appears at the bottom and is numbered in sequence with other footnotes.   \begin{table}   \centering      \begin{tabular}{l|l}      \textsc{Date}  &\textsc{Campaign} \\ \hline       1862           &Fort Donelson \\       1863           &Vicksburg     \\        1865           &Army of Northern Virginia\footnote{Ending the war.}      \end{tabular}     \caption{Forces captured by US Grant} \end{table}
