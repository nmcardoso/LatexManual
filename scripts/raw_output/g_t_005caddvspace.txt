         \addvspace{length}  Add a vertical space of height length, which is a rubber length (see Lengths).  However, if vertical space has already been added to the same point in the output by a previous \addvspace command then this command will not add more space than what is needed to make the natural length of the total vertical space equal to length.  Use this command to adjust the vertical space above or below an environment that starts a new paragraph.  For instance, a Theorem environment is defined to begin and end with \addvspace{...} so that two consecutive Theorems are separated by one vertical space, not two.  This command is fragile (see \protect).  The error Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item means that you were not in vertical mode when you invoked this command; one way to change that is to precede this command with a \par command.
