       Draws a box with a dashed line.  Synopsis:   \dashbox{dlen}(rwidth,rheight)[pos]{text}   \dashbox creates a dashed rectangle around text in a picture environment.  Dashes are dlen units long, and the rectangle has overall width rwidth and height rheight. The text is positioned at optional pos.   A dashed box looks best when the rwidth and rheight are multiples of the dlen.
