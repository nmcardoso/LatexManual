     The \  command is often used after control sequences to keep them from gobbling the space that follows, as in \TeX\ is nice. And, under normal circumstances, \tab and \newline are equivalent to \ . For another use of \ , see also \(SPACE) and \@.  Some people prefer to use {} for the same purpose, as in \TeX{} is nice. This has the advantage that you can always write it the same way, namely \TeX{}, whether it is followed by a space or by a punctuation mark. Compare:   \TeX\ is a nice system. \TeX, a nice system.  \TeX{} is a nice system. \TeX{}, a nice system.    Some individual commands, notably those defined with the xspace, package do not follow the standard behavior.
