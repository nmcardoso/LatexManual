          Mark a punctuation character, typically a period, as either ending a sentence or as ending an abbreviation.  By default, in justifying a line LaTeX adjusts the space after a sentence-ending period (or a question mark, exclamation point, comma, or colon) more than the space between words (see \frenchspacing). LaTeX assumes that the period ends a sentence unless it is preceded by a capital letter, in which case it takes that period for part of an abbreviation.  Note that if a sentence-ending period is immediately followed by a right parenthesis or bracket, or right single or double quote, then the inter-sentence space follows that parenthesis or quote.  If you have a period ending an abbreviation whose last letter is not a capital letter, and that abbreviation is not the last word in the sentence, then follow that period with a backslash-space (\ ) or a tie (~).  Examples are Nat.\ Acad.\ Science, and Mr.~Bean, and (manure, etc.)\ for sale.  For another use of \ , see \(SPACE) after control sequence.  In the opposite situation, if you have a capital letter followed by a period that ends the sentence, then put \@ before that period. For example, book by the MAA\@. will have inter-sentence spacing after the period.  In contrast, putting \@ after a period tells TeX that the period does not end the sentence.  In the example reserved words (if, then, etc.\@) are different, TeX will put interword space after the closing parenthesis (note that \@ is before the parenthesis).
