           \begin{picture}(width,height)(xoffset,yoffset)  picture commands  \end{picture}    The picture environment allows you to create just about any kind of picture you want containing text, lines, arrows and circles. You tell LaTeX where to put things in the picture by specifying their coordinates.  A coordinate is a number that may have a decimal point and a minus signa number like 5, 0.3 or -3.1416.  A coordinate specifies a length in multiples of the unit length \unitlength, so if \unitlength has been set to 1cm, then the coordinate 2.54 specifies a length of 2.54 centimeters.  You should only change the value of \unitlength, using the \setlength command, outside of a picture environment. The default value is 1pt.   A position is a pair of coordinates, such as (2.4,-5), specifying the point with x-coordinate 2.4 and y-coordinate -5. Coordinates are specified in the usual way with respect to an origin, which is normally at the lower-left corner of the picture.  Note that when a position appears as an argument, it is not enclosed in braces; the parentheses serve to delimit the argument.  The picture environment has one mandatory argument which is a position (width,height), which specifies the size of the picture.  The environment produces a rectangular box with these width and height.  The picture environment also has an optional position argument (xoffset,yoffset), following the size argument, that can change the origin.  (Unlike ordinary optional arguments, this argument is not contained in square brackets.) The optional argument gives the coordinates of the point at the lower-left corner of the picture (thereby determining the origin).  For example, if \unitlength has been set to 1mm, the command   \begin{picture}(100,200)(10,20)   produces a picture of width 100 millimeters and height 200 millimeters, whose lower-left corner is the point (10,20) and whose upper-right corner is therefore the point (110,220).  When you first draw a picture, you typically omit the optional argument, leaving the origin at the lower-left corner.  If you then want to modify your picture by shifting everything, you can just add the appropriate optional argument.  The environments mandatory argument determines the nominal size of the picture.  This need bear no relation to how large the picture really is; LaTeX will happily allow you to put things outside the picture, or even off the page.  The pictures nominal size is used by LaTeX in determining how much room to leave for it.  Everything that appears in a picture is drawn by the \put command. The command   \put (11.3,-.3){...}   puts the object specified by ... in the picture, with its reference point at coordinates (11.3,-.3). The reference points for various objects will be described below.   The \put command creates an LR box.  You can put anything that can go in an \mbox (see \mbox) in the text argument of the \put command.  When you do this, the reference point will be the lower left corner of the box.  The picture commands are described in the following sections.    \circle:Draw a circle.   \makebox (picture):Draw a box of the specified size.   \framebox (picture):Draw a box with a frame around it.   \dashbox:Draw a dashed box.   \frame:Draw a frame around an object.   \line:Draw a straight line.   \linethickness:Set the line thickness.   \thicklines:A heavier line thickness.   \thinlines:The default line thickness.   \multiput:Draw multiple instances of an object.   \oval:Draw an ellipse.   \put:Place an object at a specified place.   \shortstack:Make a pile of objects.   \vector:Draw a line with an arrow.
