     Synopsis:   \item text of item   or  \item[optional label] text of item   An entry in a list.  The entries are prefixed by a label, whose default depends on the list type.    Because the optional argument optional label is surrounded by square brackets([ and ]), to use square brackets inside the optional argument you must hide them inside curly braces, as in \item[Close square bracket, {]}].  Similarly, to use an open square bracket as first character in the text of the item, also hide it inside curly braces.  See LaTeX command syntax.  In this example the enumerate list has two items that use the default label and one that uses the optional label.   \begin{enumerate}   \item Moe   \item[sometimes] Shemp   \item Larry \end{enumerate}   The first item is labelled 1., the second item is labelled sometimes, and the third item is labelled 2. (note that, because of the optional label in the second item, the third item does not get a 3.).
