           These commands define or redefine an environment env, that is, \begin{env} body \end{env}.  Synopses:      \newenvironment{env}[nargs][optargdefault]{begdefn}{enddefn}   \newenvironment*{env}[nargs][optargdefault]{begdefn}{enddefn}  \renewenvironment{env}[nargs][optargdefault]{begdefn}{enddefn} \renewenvironment*{env}[nargs][optargdefault]{begdefn}{enddefn}    The starred form of these commands requires that the arguments not contain multiple paragraphs of text.  The body of these environments can still contain multiple paragraphs.   env Required; the environment name.  It consists only of letters or the * character, and thus does not begin with backslash (\).  It must not begin with the string end.  For \newenvironment, the name env must not be the name of an already existing environment, and also the command \env must be undefined.  For \renewenvironment, env must be the name of an existing environment.   nargs Optional; an integer from 0 to 9 denoting the number of arguments of that the environment will take.  When the environment is used these arguments appear after the \begin, as in \begin{env}{arg1}{argn}.  If this argument is not present then the default is for the environment to have no arguments.  When redefining an environment, the new version can have a different number of arguments than the old version.   optargdefault Optional; if this argument is present then the first argument of the defined environment is optional, with default value optargdefault (which may be the empty string).  If this argument is not present then the environment does not take an optional argument.  That is, when [optargdefault] is present in the environment definition, if \begin{env} is used with square brackets following, as in \begin{env}[myval], then, within begdefn, the  positional parameter #1 expands to myval.  If \begin{env} is called without square brackets following, then, within within begdefn, the positional parameter #1 expands to the default optargdefault.  In either case, any required arguments will be referred to starting with #2.  Omitting [myval] in the call is different from having the square brackets with no contents, as in [].  The former results in #1 expanding to optargdefault; the latter results in #1 expanding to the empty string.   begdefn Required; the text expanded at every occurrence of \begin{env}.  Within begdef, the nth positional parameter (i.e., #n) is replaced by the text of the nth argument.   enddefn Required; the text expanded at every occurrence of \end{env}.  This may not contain any positional parameters, so #n cannot be used here (but see the final example below).     The environment env defines a group for expanding begdefn and enddefn.  Thus, in the first example below, the effect of the \small is limited to the quote and does not extend to material following the environment.  This example gives an environment like LaTeXs quotation except that it will be set in smaller type:   \newenvironment{smallquote}{%   \small\begin{quotation} }{%   \end{quotation} }   This one shows the use of arguments; it gives a quotation environment that cites the author:   \newenvironment{citequote}[1][Shakespeare]{%   \begin{quotation}   \noindent\textit{#1}:  }{%   \end{quotation} }   The authors name is optional, and defaults to Shakespeare. In the document, use the environment like this:   \begin{citequote}[Lincoln]   ... \end{citequote}   The final example shows how to save the value of an argument to use in  enddefn, in this case in a box (see \sbox):   \newsavebox{\quoteauthor} \newenvironment{citequote}[1][Shakespeare]{%   \sbox\quoteauthor{#1}%   \begin{quotation}  }{%   \hspace{1em plus 1fill}---\usebox{\quoteauthor}   \end{quotation} }
