       Synopsis:   \include{file}   If no \includeonly command is present, the \include command executes \clearpage to start a new page (see \clearpage), then reads file, then does another \clearpage.  Given an \includeonly command, the \include actions are only run if file is listed as an argument to \includeonly.  See \includeonly.   The \include command may not appear in the preamble or in a file read by another \include command.
