       Synopsis:   \bibitem[label]{cite_key}   The \bibitem command generates an entry labelled by label. If the label argument is missing, a number is automatically generated using the enumi counter.  The cite_key is a  citation key consisting in any sequence of letters, numbers, and punctuation symbols not containing a comma.  This command writes an entry to the .aux file containing the items cite_key and label.  When the .aux file is read by the \begin{document} command, the items label is associated with cite_key, causing references to cite_key with a \cite command (see \cite) to produce the associated label.
