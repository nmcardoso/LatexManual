                Synopsis:   \begin{quotation} text \end{quotation}   or    \begin{quote} text \end{quote}   Include a quotation.   In both environments, margins are indented on both sides by \leftmargin and the text is justified at both.  As with the main text, leaving a blank line produces a new paragraph.  To compare the two: in the quotation environment, paragraphs are indented by 1.5em and the space between paragraphs is small, 0pt plus 1pt.  In the quote environment, paragraphs are not indented and there is vertical space between paragraphs (it is the rubber length \parsep).  Thus, the quotation environment may be more suitable for documents where new paragraphs are marked by an indent rather than by a vertical separation.  In addition, quote may be more suitable for a short quotation or a sequence of short quotations.   \begin{quotation} \it Four score and seven years ago   ... shall not perish from the earth. \hspace{1em plus 1fill}---Abraham Lincoln \end{quotation}
