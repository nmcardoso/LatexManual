        This is an unofficial reference manual for the LaTeX2e document preparation system, which is a macro package for the TeX typesetting program (see Overview).  This documents home page is http://home.gna.org/latexrefman.  That page has links to the current output in various formats, sources, mailing list archives and subscriptions, and other infrastructure.   In this document, we will mostly just use LaTeX rather than LaTeX2e, since the previous version of LaTeX(2.09) was retired many years ago.     LaTeX is currently maintained by a group of volunteers (http://latex-project.org).  The official documentation written by the LaTeX project is available from their web site.  This document is completely unofficial and has not been reviewed by the LaTeX maintainers.  Do not send bug reports or anything else about this document to them.  Instead, please send all comments to latexrefman-discuss@gna.org.  This document is a reference.  There is a vast array of other sources of information about LaTeX, at all levels.  Here are a few introductions.   http://ctan.org/pkg/latex-doc-ptr  Two pages of recommended references to LaTeX documentation.   http://ctan.org/pkg/first-latex-doc  Writing your first document, with a bit of both text and math.   http://ctan.org/pkg/usrguide  The guide for document authors that is maintained as part of LaTeX; there are plenty of others available elsewhere.   http://ctan.org/pkg/lshort  A short introduction to LaTeX, translated to many languages.   http://tug.org/begin.html Introduction to the TeX system, including LaTeX, with further references.
