     You can refer to a single footnote more than once.  This example uses the package cleverref.   \usepackage{cleveref}[2012/02/15]   % this version of package or later  \crefformat{footnote}{#2\footnotemark[#1]#3} ... \begin{document} ... The theorem is from Evers.\footnote{\label{fn:TE}Tinker and Evers, 1994.} The corollary is from Chance.\footnote{Evers and Chance, 1990.} But the key lemma is from Tinker.\cref{fn:TE} ...   This solution will work with the package hyperref. See\footnotemark for a simpler solution in the common case of multiple authors with the same affiliation.
