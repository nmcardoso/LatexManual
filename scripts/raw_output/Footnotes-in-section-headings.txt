       Putting a footnote in a section heading, as in:   \section{Full sets\protect\footnote{This material due to ...}}     causes the footnote to appear at the bottom of the page where the section starts, as usual, but also at the bottom of the table of contents, where it is not likely to be desired.  To have it not appear on the table of contents use the package footmisc with the stable option.   \usepackage[stable]{footmisc} ... \begin{document} ... \section{Full sets\footnote{This material due to ...}}   Note that the \protect is gone; including it would cause the footnote to reappear on the table of contents.
