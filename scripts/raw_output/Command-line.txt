        The input file specification indicates the file to be formatted; TeX uses .tex as a default file extension.  If you omit the input file entirely, TeX accepts input from the terminal.  You can also specify arbitrary LaTeX input by starting with a backslash. For example, this processes foo.tex without pausing after every error:   latex '\nonstopmode\input foo.tex'    With many, but not all, implementations, command-line options can also be specified in the usual Unix way, starting with - or --.  For a list of those options, try latex --help.     If LaTeX stops in the middle of the document and gives you a * prompt, it is waiting for input.  You can type \stop (and return) and it will prematurely end the document.  See TeX engines, for other system commands invoking LaTeX.
