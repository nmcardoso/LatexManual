        Declaration that causes material in its scope to be centered.  It is most often used inside an environment such as figure, or in a parbox.  Unlike the center environment, the \centering command does not add vertical space above and below the text.  It also does not start a new paragraph; it simply changes how LaTeX formats paragraph units.  If ww {\centering xx \\ yy} zz is surrounded by blank lines then LaTeX will create a paragraph whose first line ww xx is centered and whose second line, not centered, contains yy zz.  Usually what is desired is for the scope of the declaration to contain a blank line or the \end command of an environment such as figure or table that ends the paragraph unit.  Thus, if {\centering xx \\ yy\par} zz is surrounded by blank lines then it makes a new paragraph with two centered lines xx and yy, followed by a new paragraph with zz that is formatted as usual.  See also the following example.  This examples \centering causes the graphic to be horizontally centered.     \begin{figure}   \centering   \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ctan_lion.png}   \caption{CTAN Lion}  \label{fig:CTANLion} \end{figure}   The scope of the \centering ends with the \end{figure}.
