        Produce an infinite rubber length (see Lengths) filled with a horizontal rule (that is, a line) or with dots, instead of just white space.  When placed between blank lines this example creates a paragraph that is left and right justified, where the space in the middle is filled with evenly spaced dots.   \noindent Jack Aubrey\dotfill Melbury Lodge   To make the rule or dots go to the lines end use \null at the start or end.    To change the rules thickness, copy the definition and adjust it, as with \renewcommand{\hrulefill}{\leavevmode\leaders\hrule height 1pt\hfill\kern\z@}, which changes the default thickness of 0.4pt to 1pt.  Similarly, adjust the dot spacing as with \renewcommand{\dotfill}{\leavevmode\cleaders\hb@xt@ 1.00em{\hss .\hss }\hfill\kern\z@}, which changes the default length of 0.33em to 1.00em.
