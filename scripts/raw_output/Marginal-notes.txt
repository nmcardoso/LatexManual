          Synopsis:   \marginpar[left]{right}   The \marginpar command creates a note in the margin.  The first line of the note will have the same baseline as the line in the text where the \marginpar occurs.  When you only specify the mandatory argument right, the text will be placed    in the right margin for one-sided layout (option oneside, see Document class options);  in the outside margin for two-sided layout (option twoside, see Document class options);  in the nearest margin for two-column layout (option twocolumn, see Document class options).     The command \reversemarginpar places subsequent marginal notes in the opposite (inside) margin.  \normalmarginpar places them in the default position.  When you specify both arguments, left is used for the left margin, and right is used for the right margin.  The first word will normally not be hyphenated; you can enable hyphenation there by beginning the node with \hspace{0pt}.  These parameters affect the formatting of the note:   \marginparpush   Minimum vertical space between notes; default 7pt for 12pt documents, 5pt else.   \marginparsep   Horizontal space between the main text and the note; default 11pt for 10pt documents, 10pt else.   \marginparwidth   Width of the note itself; default for a one-sided 10pt document is 90pt, 83pt for 11pt, and 68pt for 12pt; 17pt more in each case for a two-sided document. In two column mode, the default is 48pt.     The standard LaTeX routine for marginal notes does not prevent notes from falling off the bottom of the page.
