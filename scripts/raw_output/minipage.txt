          \begin{minipage}[position][height][inner-pos]{width} text \end{minipage}   The minipage environment typesets its body text in a block that will not be broken across pages.  This is similar to the \parbox command (see \parbox), but unlike \parbox, other paragraph-making environments can be used inside a minipage.  The arguments are the same as for \parbox (see \parbox).     By default, paragraphs are not indented in the minipage environment.  You can restore indentation with a command such as \setlength{\parindent}{1pc} command.    Footnotes in a minipage environment are handled in a way that is particularly useful for putting footnotes in figures or tables.  A \footnote or \footnotetext command puts the footnote at the bottom of the minipage instead of at the bottom of the page, and it uses the \mpfootnote counter instead of the ordinary footnote counter (see Counters).  However, dont put one minipage inside another if you are using footnotes; they may wind up at the bottom of the wrong minipage.
