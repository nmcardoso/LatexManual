         \footnoterule   Produces the rule separating the main text on a page from the pages footnotes.  Default dimensions: 0.4pt thick (or wide), and 0.4\columnwidth long in the standard document classes (except slides, where it does not appear).   \footnotesep   The height of the strut placed at the beginning of the footnote.  By default, this is set to the normal strut for \footnotesize fonts (see Font sizes), therefore there is no extra space between footnotes.  This is 6.65pt for 10pt, 7.7pt for 11pt, and 8.4pt for 12pt.
