          Synopses:   \pagebreak[priority] \nopagebreak[priority]   By default, the \pagebreak (\nopagebreak) command forces (prevents) a page break at the current position.  With \pagebreak, the vertical space on the page is stretched out where possible so that it extends to the normal bottom margin.  With the optional argument priority, you can convert the \pagebreak command from a demand to a request.  The number must be a number from 0 to4.  The higher the number, the more insistent the request is.
