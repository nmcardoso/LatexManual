          End the current paragraph and insert a vertical rubber length (see Lengths) that is infinite, so it can stretch or shrink as far as needed.  It is often used in the same way as \vspace{\fill}, except that \vfill ends the current paragraph, whereas \vspace{\fill} adds the infinite vertical space below its line irrespective of the paragraph structure.  In both cases that space will disappear at a page boundary; to circumvent this see\vspace.  In this example the page is filled, so the top and bottom lines contain the text Lost Dog! and the third Lost Dog! is exactly halfway between them.    \begin{document} Lost Dog! \vfill Lost Dog! \vfill Lost Dog! \end{document}
