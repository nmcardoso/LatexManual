      Draw a vertical line in a tabular or array environment extending the full height and depth of an entrys row.  Can also be used in an @-expression, although its synonym vertical bar| is more common.  This command is rarely used in the body of a table; typically a tables vertical lines are specified in tabulars cols argument and overridden as needed with \multicolumn.  This example illustrates some pitfalls.  In the first lines second entry the \hfill moves the \vline to the left edge of the cell.  But that is different than putting it halfway between the two columns, so in that row between the first and second columns there are two vertical rules, with the one from the {c|cc} specifier coming before the one produced by the \vline\hfill.  In contrast, the first lines third entry shows the usual way to put a vertical bar between two columns.  In the second line, the ghi is the widest entry in its column so in the \vline\hfill the \hfill has no effect and the vertical line in that entry appears immediately next to the g, with no whitespace.   \begin{tabular}{c|cc}   x   &\vline\hfill y   &\multicolumn{1}{|r}{z} \\     abc &def &\vline\hfill ghi  \end{tabular}
