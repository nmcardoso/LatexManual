        In ordinary text this is equivalent to double-backslash (see \\); it breaks a line, with no stretching of the text before it.  Inside a tabular or array environment, in a column with a specifier producing a paragraph box, like typically p{...}, \newline will insert a line break inside of the column, that is, it does not break the entire row.  To break the entire row use \\ or its equivalent \tabularnewline.  This will print Name: and Address: as two lines in a single cell of the table.   \begin{tabular}{p{1in}{\hspace{2in}}p{1in}}   Name: \newline Address: &Date: \\ \hline \end{tabular}   The Date: will be baseline-aligned with Name:.
