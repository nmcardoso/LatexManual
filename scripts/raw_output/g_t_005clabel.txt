       Synopsis:   \label{key}   Assign a number to key.  In ordinary text \label{key} assigns to key the number of the current sectional unit. Inside an environment with numbering, such as a table or theorem environment, \label{key} assigns to key the number of that environment.  Retrieve the assigned number with the \ref{key} command (see \ref).  A key name can consist of any sequence of letters, digits, or common punctuation characters.  Upper and lowercase letters are distinguished, as usual.  A common convention is to use labels consisting of a prefix and a suffix separated by a colon or period.  This helps to avoid accidentally creating two labels with the same name, and makes your source more readable.  Some commonly-used prefixes:   ch for chapters  sec for lower-level sectioning commands  fig for figures  tab for tables  eq for equations    Thus, \label{fig:Euler} is a label for a figure with a portrait of the great man.  In this example below the key sec:test will get the number of the current section and the key fig:test will get the number of the figure.  (Incidentally, put labels after captions in figures and tables.)   \section{section name} \label{sec:test} This is Section~\ref{sec:test}. \begin{figure}   ...   \caption{caption text}   \label{fig:test} \end{figure} See Figure~\ref{fig:test}.
