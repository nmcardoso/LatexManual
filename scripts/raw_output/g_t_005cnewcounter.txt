        Synopsis, one of:   \newcounter{countername} \newcounter{countername}[supercounter]   Globally defines a new counter named countername and initialize the new counter to zero.  The name countername must consists of letters only, and does not begin with a backslash.  This name must not already be in use by another counter.  When you use the optional argument [supercounter] then countername will be numbered within, or subsidiary to, the existing counter supercounter.  For example, ordinarily subsection is numbered within section so that any time supercounter is incremented with \stepcounter (see \stepcounter) or \refstepcounter (see \refstepcounter) then countername is reset to zero.  See Counters, for more information about counters.
