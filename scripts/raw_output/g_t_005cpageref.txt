         Synopsis:   \pageref{key}   Produce the page number of the place in the text where the corresponding \label{key} command appears.  In this example the \label{eq:main} is used both for the formula number and for the page number.  (Note that the two references are forward references, so this document would need to be compiled twice to resolve those.)   The main result is formula~\ref{eq:main} on page~\pageref{eq:main}.   ... \begin{equation} \label{eq:main}    \mathbf{P}=\mathbf{NP} \end{equation}
