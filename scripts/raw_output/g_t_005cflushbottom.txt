       Make all pages in the documents after this declaration have the same height, by stretching the vertical space where necessary to fill out the page.  This is most often used when making two-sided documents since the differences in facing pages can be glaring.  If TeX cannot satisfactorily stretch the vertical space in a page then you get a message like Underfull \vbox (badness 10000) has occurred while \output is active.  If you get that, one option is to change to \raggedbottom (see \raggedbottom).  Alternatively, you can adjust the textheight to make compatible pages, or you can add some vertical stretch glue between lines or between paragraphs, as in \setlength{\parskip}{0ex plus0.1ex}.  Your last option is to, in a final editing stage, adjust the height of individual pages (see \enlargethispage).  The \flushbottom state is the default only if you select the twoside document class option (see Document class options).
