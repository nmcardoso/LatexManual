          Synopsis:   \begin{figure}[placement]   figure body \caption[loftitle]{title} \label{label} \end{figure}   or   \begin{figure*}[placement]   figure body \caption[loftitle]{title} \label{label} \end{figure*}   A class of floats (see Floats).  Because they cannot be split across pages, they are not typeset in sequence with the normal text but instead are floated to a convenient place, such as the top of a following page.  For the possible values of placement and their effect on the  float placement algorithm, see Floats.  The starred form figure* is used when a document is in double-column mode (see \twocolumn).  It produces a figure that spans both columns, at the top of the page.  To add the possibility of placing at a page bottom see the discussion of placement b in Floats.  The figure body is typeset in a parbox of width \textwidth and so it can contain text, commands, etc.  The label is optional; it is used for cross references (see Cross references).  The optional \caption command specifies caption text for the figure.  By default it is numbered.  If loftitle is present, it is used in the list of figures instead of title (see Tables of contents).  This example makes a figure out of a graphic.  It requires one of the packages graphics or graphicx.  The graphic, with its caption, will be placed at the top of a page or, if it is pushed to the end of the document, on a page of floats.   \begin{figure}[t]   \centering   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{CTANlion.png}   \caption{The CTAN lion, by Duane Bibby} \end{figure}
