         A table of contents is produced with the \tableofcontents command.  You put the command right where you want the table of contents to go; LaTeX does the rest for you.  A previous run must have generated a .toc file.  The \tableofcontents command produces a heading, but it does not automatically start a new page.  If you want a new page after the table of contents, write a \newpage command after the \tableofcontents command.      The analogous commands \listoffigures and \listoftables produce a list of figures and a list of tables (from .lof and .lot files), respectively.  Everything works exactly the same as for the table of contents.   The command \nofiles overrides these commands, and prevents any of these lists from being generated.    \addcontentsline:Add an entry to table of contents, etc.   \addtocontents:Add text directly to table of contents file, etc.
