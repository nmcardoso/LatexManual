         LaTeX provides many environments for delimiting certain behavior. An environment begins with \begin and ends with \end, like this:   \begin{environment-name}   ... \end{environment-name}   The environment-name at the beginning must exactly match that at the end. For instance, the input \begin{table*}...\end{table} will cause an error like: ! LaTeX Error: \begin{table*} on input line 5 ended by \end{table}.    abstract:Produce an abstract.   array:Math arrays.   center:Centered lines.   description:Labelled lists.   displaymath:Formulas that appear on their own line.   document:Enclose the whole document.   enumerate:Numbered lists.   eqnarray:Sequences of aligned equations.   equation:Displayed equation.   figure:Floating figures.   filecontents:Writing multiple files from the source.   flushleft:Flushed left lines.   flushright:Flushed right lines.   itemize:Bulleted lists.   letter:Letters.   list:Generic list environment.   math:In-line math.   minipage:Miniature page.   picture:Picture with text, arrows, lines and circles.   quotation and quote:Include a quotation.   tabbing:Align text arbitrarily.   table:Floating tables.   tabular:Align text in columns.   thebibliography:Bibliography or reference list.   theorem:Theorems, lemmas, etc.   titlepage:For hand crafted title pages.   verbatim:Simulating typed input.   verse:For poetry and other things.
