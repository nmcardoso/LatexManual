       Synopsis:   \makebox(width,height)[position]{text}   The \makebox command for the picture environment is similar to the normal \makebox command except that you must specify a width and height in multiples of \unitlength.  The optional argument, [position], specifies the quadrant that your text appears in.  You may select up to two of the following:   t Moves the item to the top of the rectangle.   b Moves the item to the bottom.   l Moves the item to the left.   r Moves the item to the right.     See \makebox.
