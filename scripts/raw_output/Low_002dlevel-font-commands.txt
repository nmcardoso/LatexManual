        These commands are primarily intended for writers of macros and packages.  The commands listed here are only a subset of the available ones.   \fontencoding{encoding}  Select the font encoding, the encoding of the output font. There are a large number of valid encodings.  The most common are OT1, Knuths original encoding for Computer Modern (the default), and T1, also known as the Cork encoding, which has support for the accented characters used by the most widespread European languages (German, French, Italian, Polish and others), which allows TeX to hyphenate words containing accented letters.   \fontfamily{family}    Select the font family.  The web page http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/ provides one way to browse through many of the fonts easily used with LaTeX.  Here are examples of some common families:     pag Avant Garde  fvs Bitstream Vera Sans  pbk Bookman  bch Charter  ccr Computer Concrete  cmr Computer Modern  pcr Courier  phv Helvetica  fi4 Inconsolata  lmr Latin Modern  lmss Latin Modern Sans  lmtt Latin Modern Typewriter  pnc New Century Schoolbook  ppl Palatino  ptm Times  uncl Uncial  put Utopia  pzc Zapf Chancery    \fontseries{series}   Select the font series.  A series combines a weight and a width.  Typically, a font supports only a few of the possible combinations.  Some common combined series values include:    m Medium (normal)  b Bold  c Condensed  bc Bold condensed  bx Bold extended    The possible values for weight, individually, are:    ul Ultra light  el Extra light  l Light  sl Semi light  m Medium (normal)  sb Semi bold  b Bold  eb Extra bold  ub Ultra bold     The possible values for width, individually, are (the percentages are just guides and are not followed precisely by all fonts):    uc Ultra condensed, 50%  ec Extra condensed, 62.5%  c Condensed, 75%  sc Semi condensed, 87.5%  m Medium, 100%  sx Semi expanded, 112.5%  x Expanded, 125%  ex Extra expanded, 150%  ux Ultra expanded, 200%   When forming the series string from the weight and width, drop the m that stands for medium weight or medium width, unless both weight and width are m, in which case use just one (m).    \fontshape{shape}   Select font shape. Valid shapes are:    n Upright (normal)  it Italic  sl Slanted (oblique)  sc Small caps  ui Upright italics  ol Outline   The two last shapes are not available for most font families, and small caps are often missing as well.   \fontsize{size}{skip}    Set the font size and the line spacing.  The unit of both parameters defaults to points (pt).  The line spacing is the nominal vertical space between lines, baseline to baseline.  It is stored in the parameter \baselineskip.  The default \baselineskip for the Computer Modern typeface is 1.2 times the \fontsize. Changing \baselineskip directly is inadvisable since its value is reset every time a size change happens; see \baselinestretch, next.   \baselinestretch  LaTeX multiplies the line spacing by the value of the \baselinestretch parameter; the default factor is 1.  A change takes effect when \selectfont (see below) is called.  You can make line skip changes happen for the entire document by doing \renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{2.0} in the preamble.    However, the best way to double-space a document is to use the setspace package.  In addition to offering a number of spacing options, this package keeps the line spacing single-spaced in places where that is typically desirable, such as footnotes and figure captions.  See the package documentation.   \linespread{factor}  Equivalent to \renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{factor}, and therefore must be followed by \selectfont to have any effect. Best specified in the preamble, or use the setspace package, as just described.   \selectfont  The effects of the font commands described above do not happen until \selectfont is called, as in \fontfamily{familyname}\selectfont.  It is often useful to put this in a macro: \newcommand*{\myfont}{\fontfamily{familyname}\selectfont} (see \newcommand & \renewcommand).   \usefont{enc}{family}{series}{shape}  The same as invoking \fontencoding, \fontfamily, \fontseries and \fontshape with the given parameters, followed by \selectfont.  For example:   \usefont{ot1}{cmr}{m}{n}
