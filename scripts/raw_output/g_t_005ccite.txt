       Synopsis:   \cite[subcite]{keys}   The keys argument is a list of one or more citation keys (see \bibitem), separated by commas.  This command generates an in-text citation to the references associated with keys by entries in the .aux file.  The text of the optional subcite argument appears after the citation.  For example, \cite[p.~314]{knuth} might produce [Knuth, p.314].
