     Synopsis:   \signature{first line \\             ... }     The senders name.  This command is optional, although its inclusion is usual.  The argument text appears at the end of the letter, after the closing and after a vertical space for the traditional hand-written signature. Separate multiple lines with a double backslash\\.  For example:   \signature{J Fred Muggs \\            White House}   LaTeXs default for the vertical space from the \closing text down to the \signature text is 6\medskipamount, which is six times 0.7em.  This command is usually in the preamble, to apply to all the letters in the document.  To have it apply to one letter only, put it inside a letter environment and before the \closing.  You can include a graphic in the signature, for instance with \signature{\vspace{-6\medskipamount}\includegraphics{sig.png}\\ My name} (this requires writing \usepackage{graphicx} in the preamble).
