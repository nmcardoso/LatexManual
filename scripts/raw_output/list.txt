         The list environment is a generic environment which is used for defining many of the more specific environments. It is seldom used in documents, but often in macros.   \begin{list}{labeling}{spacing} \item item1 \item item2 ... \end{list}   The mandatory labeling argument specifies how items should be labelled (unless the optional argument is supplied to \item). This argument is a piece of text that is inserted in a box to form the label.  It can and usually does contain other LaTeX commands.  The mandatory spacing argument contains commands to change the spacing parameters for the list.  This argument will most often be empty, i.e., {}, which leaves the default spacing.  The width used for typesetting the list items is specified by \linewidth (see Page layout parameters).    \item:An entry in a list.
