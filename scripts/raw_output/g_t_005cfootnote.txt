       Synopsis:   \footnote[number]{text}   Place a numbered footnote text at the bottom of the current page.   There are over a thousand footnotes in Gibbon's  \textit{Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire}.\footnote{After reading an early version with endnotes David Hume complained,  ``One is also plagued with his Notes, according to the present Method  of printing the Book'' and suggested that they ``only to be printed  at the Margin or the Bottom of the Page.''}   The optional argument number allows you to specify the footnote number.  If you use this option then the footnote number counter is not incremented, and if you do not use it then the counter is incremented.     Change how LaTeX shows the footnote counter with something like \renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\fnsymbol{footnote}}, which uses a sequence of symbols (see \alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman \fnsymbol).  To make this change global put that in the preamble.  If you make the change local then you may want to reset the counter with \setcounter{footnote}{0}.  By default LaTeX uses arabic numbers.  LaTeXs default puts many restrictions on where you can use a \footnote; for instance, you cannot use it in an argument to a sectioning command such as \chapter (it can only be used in outer paragraph mode).  There are some workarounds; see following sections.    In a minipage environment the \footnote command uses the mpfootnote counter instead of the footnote counter, so they are numbered independently.  They are shown at the bottom of the environment, not at the bottom of the page. And by default they are shown alphabetically. See minipage.
