       Synopsis:   \makelabels   Create a sheet of address labels from the recipient addresses, one for each letter. This sheet will be output before the letters, with the idea that you can copy it to a sheet of peel-off labels.  This command goes in the preamble.  Customize the labels by redefining the commands \startlabels, \mlabel, and \returnaddress in the preamble.  The command \startlabels sets the width, height, number of columns, etc., of the page onto which the labels are printed.  The command \mlabel{sender address}{recipient address} produces the two labels (or one, if you choose to ignore the sender address). The sender address is the value returned by the macro \returnaddress while recipient address is the value passed in the argument to the letter environment.  By default \mlabel ignores the first argument, the sender address.
