             \columnsep   \columnseprule   \columnwidth      The distance between the two columns, the width of a rule between the columns, and the width of the columns, when the document class option twocolumn is in effect (see Document class options). See \twocolumn.   \headheight    Height of the box that contains the running head.  The default in the article, report, and book classes is 12pt, at all type sizes.   \headsep    Vertical distance between the bottom of the header line and the top of the main text.  The default in the article and report classes is 25pt.  In the book class the default is: if the document is set at 10pt then it is 0.25in, and at 11pt and 12pt it is 0.275in.   \footskip    Distance from the baseline of the last line of text to the baseline of the page footer.  The default in the article and report classes is 30pt.  In the book class the default is: when the type size is 10pt the default is 0.35in, while at 11pt it is 0.38in, and at 12pt it is 30pt.   \linewidth    Width of the current line, decreased for each nested list (see list).  That is, the nominal value for \linewidth is to equal \textwidth but for each nested list the \linewidth is decreased by the sum of that lists \leftmargin and \rightmargin (see itemize).   \marginparpush   \marginsep   \marginparwidth      The minimum vertical space between two marginal notes, the horizontal space between the text body and the marginal notes, and the horizontal width of the notes.  Normally marginal notes appear on the outside of the page, but the declaration \reversemarginpar changes that (and \normalmarginpar changes it back).  The defaults for \marginparpush in both book and article classes are: 7pt if the document is set at 12pt, and 5pt if the document is set at 11pt or 10pt.  For \marginsep, in article class the default is 10pt except if the document is set at 10pt and in two-column mode where the default is 11pt.  For \marginsep in book class the default is 10pt in two-column mode and 7pt in one-column mode.    For \marginparwidth in both book and article classes, in two-column mode the default is 60% of \paperwidth - \textwidth, while in one-column mode it is 50% of that distance.   \oddsidemargin   \evensidemargin     The \oddsidemargin is the extra distance between the left side of the page and the texts left margin, on odd-numbered pages when the document class option twoside is chosen and on all pages when oneside is in effect.  When twoside is in effect, on even-numbered pages the extra distance on the left is evensidemargin.  LaTeXs default is that \oddsidemargin is 40% of the difference between \paperwidth and \textwidth, and \evensidemargin is the remainder.   \paperheight    The height of the paper, as distinct from the height of the print area. It is normally set with a document class option, as in \documentclass[a4paper]{article} (see Document class options).   \paperwidth    The width of the paper, as distinct from the width of the print area. It is normally set with a document class option, as in \documentclass[a4paper]{article} (see Document class options).   \textheight    The normal vertical height of the page body.  If the document is set at a nominal type size of 10pt then for an article or report the default is 43\baselineskip, while for a book it is 41\baselineskip.  At a type size of 11pt the default is 38\baselineskip for all document classes.  At 12pt it is 36\baselineskip for all classes.   \textwidth    The full horizontal width of the entire page body.  For an article or report document, the default is 345pt when the chosen type size is 10pt, the default is 360pt at 11pt, and it is 390pt at 12pt.  For a book document, the default is 4.5in at a type size of 10pt, and 5in at 11pt or 12pt.  In multi-column output, \textwidth remains the width of the entire page body, while \columnwidth is the width of one column (see \twocolumn).  In lists (see list), \textwidth remains the width of the entire page body (and \columnwidth the width of the entire column), while \linewidth may decrease for nested lists.  Inside a minipage (see minipage) or \parbox (see \parbox), all the width-related parameters are set to the specified width, and revert to their normal values at the end of the minipage or \parbox.    This entry is included for completeness: \hsize is the TeX primitive parameter used when text is broken into lines.  It should not be used in normal LaTeX documents.   \topmargin    Space between the top of the TeX page (one inch from the top of the paper, by default) and the top of the header.  The value is computed based on many other parameters: \paperheight - 2in - \headheight - \headsep - \textheight - \footskip, and then divided by two.   \topskip    Minimum distance between the top of the page body and the baseline of the first line of text.  For the standard classes, the default is the same as the font size, e.g., 10pt at a type size of 10pt.
