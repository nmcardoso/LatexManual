           Define a new theorem-like environment.  Synopses:   \newtheorem{name}{title} \newtheorem{name}{title}[numbered_within] \newtheorem{name}[numbered_like]{title}   Using the first form, \newtheorem{name}{title} creates an environment that will be labelled with title.  See the first example below.  The second form \newtheorem{name}{title}[numbered_within] creates an environment whose counter is subordinate to the existing counter numbered_within (its counter will be reset when numbered_within is reset).   The third form \newtheorem{name}[numbered_like]{title}, with optional argument between the two required arguments, will create an environment whose counter will share the previously defined counter numbered_like.  You can specify one of numbered_within and numbered_like, or neither, but not both.  This command creates a counter named name.  In addition, unless the optional argument numbered_like is used, inside of the theorem-like environment the current \ref value will be that of \thenumbered_within (see \ref).  This declaration is global.  It is fragile (see \protect).  Arguments:   name The name of the environment.  It must not begin with a backslash (\).  It must not be the name of an existing environment; indeed, the command name \name must not already be defined as anything.   title The text printed at the beginning of the environment, before the number. For example, Theorem.   numbered_within Optional; the name of an already defined counter, usually a sectional unit such as chapter or section.  When the numbered_within counter is reset then the name environments counter will also be reset.  If this optional argument is not used then the command \thename is set to \arabic{name}.   numbered_like Optional; the name of an already defined theorem-like environment. The new environment will be numbered in sequence with numbered_like.     Without any optional arguments the environments are numbered sequentially.  The example below has a declaration in the preamble that results in Definition1 and Definition2 in the output.   \newtheorem{defn}{Definition} \begin{document} \section{...} \begin{defn}   First def  \end{defn}  \section{...} \begin{defn}   Second def \end{defn}   Because the next example specifies the optional argument numbered_within to \newtheorem as section, the example, with the same document body, gives Definition1.1 and Definition2.1.   \newtheorem{defn}{Definition}[section] \begin{document} \section{...} \begin{defn}   First def  \end{defn}  \section{...} \begin{defn}   Second def \end{defn}   In the next example there are two declarations in the preamble, the second of which calls for the new thm environment to use the same counter as defn.  It gives Definition1.1, followed by Theorem2.1 and Definition2.2.   \newtheorem{defn}{Definition}[section] \newtheorem{thm}[defn]{Theorem} \begin{document} \section{...} \begin{defn}   First def  \end{defn}  \section{...} \begin{thm}   First thm \end{thm}  \begin{defn}   Second def \end{defn}
