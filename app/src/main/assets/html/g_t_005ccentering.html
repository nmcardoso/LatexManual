<h4 class="subsection"><code>\centering</code></h4>

<p>Declaration that causes material in its scope to be centered.  It is
most often used inside an environment such as <code>figure</code>, or in a
<code>parbox</code>.
</p>
<p>Unlike the <code>center</code> environment, the <code>\centering</code> command does
not add vertical space above and below the text.
</p>
<p>It also does not start a new paragraph; it simply changes how LaTeX
formats paragraph units.  If <code>ww {\centering xx \\ yy} zz</code> is
surrounded by blank lines then LaTeX will create a paragraph whose
first line &#8216;<samp>ww xx</samp>&#8217; is centered and whose second line, not centered,
contains &#8216;<samp>yy zz</samp>&#8217;.  Usually what is desired is for the scope of the
declaration to contain a blank line or the <code>\end</code> command of an
environment such as <code>figure</code> or <code>table</code> that ends the
paragraph unit.  Thus, if <code>{\centering xx \\ yy\par} zz</code> is
surrounded by blank lines then it makes a new paragraph with two
centered lines &#8216;<samp>xx</samp>&#8217; and &#8216;<samp>yy</samp>&#8217;, followed by a new paragraph with
&#8216;<samp>zz</samp>&#8217; that is formatted as usual.  See also the following example.
</p>
<p>This example&#8217;s <code>\centering</code> causes the graphic to be horizontally
centered.  
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ctan_lion.png}
  \caption{CTAN Lion}  \label{fig:CTANLion}
\end{figure}
</pre></div>

<p>The scope of the <code>\centering</code> ends with the <code>\end{figure}</code>.
