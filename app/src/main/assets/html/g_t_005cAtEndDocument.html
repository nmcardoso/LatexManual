<p>Synopsis:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\AtEndDocument{<var>code</var>}
</pre></div>

<p>Save <var>code</var> and execute it near the end of the document.
Specifically, it is executed when <code>\end{document}</code> is executed,
before the final page is finished and before any leftover floating
environments are processed. If you want some of the code to be executed
after these two processes then include a <code>\clearpage</code> at the
appropriate point in <var>code</var>.
</p>
<p>You can issue this command more than once; the successive code lines
will be executed in the order that you gave them.
</p>
