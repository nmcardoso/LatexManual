<h3 class="section"><code>\address</code></h3>

<a name="index-_005caddress"></a>

<p>Synopsis: 
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\address{<var>senders address</var>}
</pre></div>

<p>Specifies the return address as it appears on the letter and on the
envelope.  Separate multiple lines in <var>senders address</var> with a
double backslash <code>\\</code>.
</p>
<p>Because it can apply to multiple letters this declaration is often put
in the preamble.  However, it can go anywhere, including inside an
individual <code>letter</code> environment.
</p>
<p>This command is optional: without the <code>\address</code> declaration the
letter is formatted with some blank space on top, for copying onto
pre-printed letterhead paper.  (See <a href="Overview.html">Overview</a>, for details on your
local implementation.)  With the <code>\address</code> declaration, it is
formatted as a personal letter.
</p>
<p>Here is an example.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\address{Stephen Maturin \\
         The Grapes of the Savoy}
</pre></div>
