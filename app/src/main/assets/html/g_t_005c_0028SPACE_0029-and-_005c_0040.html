<p>Mark a punctuation character, typically a period, as either ending a
sentence or as ending an abbreviation.
</p>
<p>By default, in justifying a line LaTeX adjusts the space after a
sentence-ending period (or a question mark, exclamation point, comma, or
colon) more than the space between words
(see <a href="g_t_005cfrenchspacing.html">\frenchspacing</a>). LaTeX assumes that the period ends a
sentence unless it is preceded by a capital letter, in which case it
takes that period for part of an abbreviation.  Note that if a
sentence-ending period is immediately followed by a right parenthesis or
bracket, or right single or double quote, then the inter-sentence space
follows that parenthesis or quote.
</p>
<p>If you have a period ending an abbreviation whose last letter is not a
capital letter, and that abbreviation is not the last word in the
sentence, then follow that period with a backslash-space (<code>\ </code>) or
a tie (<code>~</code>).  Examples are <code>Nat.\ Acad.\ Science</code>, and
<code>Mr.~Bean</code>, and <code>(manure, etc.)\ for sale</code>.
</p>
<p>For another use of <code>\ </code>, see <a href="g_t_005c_0028SPACE_0029-after-control-sequence.html">\(SPACE) after control sequence</a>.
</p>
<p>In the opposite situation, if you have a capital letter followed by a
period that ends the sentence, then put <code>\@</code> before that period.
For example, <code>book by the MAA\@.</code> will have inter-sentence
spacing after the period.
</p>
<p>In contrast, putting <code>\@</code> after a period tells TeX that the
period does not end the sentence.  In the example <code>reserved words
(if, then, etc.\@) are different</code>, TeX will put interword space
after the closing parenthesis (note that <code>\@</code> is before the
parenthesis).
