<p>LaTeX is a system for typesetting documents.  It was originally
created by Leslie Lamport and is now maintained by a group of volunteers
(<a href="http://latex-project.org">http://latex-project.org</a>).  It is widely used, particularly for
complex and technical documents, such as those involving mathematics.

<p>A LaTeX user writes an input file containing text along with
interspersed commands, for instance commands describing how the text
should be formatted.  It is implemented as a set of related commands
that interface with Donald E. Knuth&#8217;s TeX typesetting program
(the technical term is that LaTeX is a <em>macro package</em> for the
TeX engine).  The user produces the output document by giving that
input file to the TeX engine.
</p>
<p>The term LaTeX is also sometimes used to mean the language in which
the document is marked up, that is, to mean the set of commands
available to a LaTeX user.

<p>The name LaTeX is short for &#8220;Lamport TeX&#8221;.  It is pronounced
LAH-teck or LAY-teck, or sometimes LAY-tecks.  Inside a document,
produce the logo with <code>\LaTeX</code>.  Where use of the logo is not
sensible, such as in plain text, write it as &#8216;<samp>LaTeX</samp>&#8217;.
