<h3 class="section"><code>\addvspace</code></h3>

<p><code>\addvspace{<var>length</var>}</code>
</p>
<p>Add a vertical space of height <var>length</var>, which is a rubber length
(see <a href="Lengths.html">Lengths</a>).  However, if vertical space has already been added to
the same point in the output by a previous <code>\addvspace</code> command
then this command will not add more space than what is needed to make
the natural length of the total vertical space equal to <var>length</var>.
</p>
<p>Use this command to adjust the vertical space above or below an
environment that starts a new paragraph.  For instance, a Theorem
environment is defined to begin and end with <code>\addvspace{...}</code>
so that two consecutive Theorem&#8217;s are separated by one vertical space,
not two.
</p>
<p>This command is fragile (see <a href="g_t_005cprotect.html">\protect</a>).
</p>
<p>The error &#8216;<samp>Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item</samp>&#8217; means that
you were not in vertical mode when you invoked this command; one way to
change that is to precede this command with a <code>\par</code> command.
