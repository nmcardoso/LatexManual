<p>When LaTeX is processing your input text, it is always in one of three
modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Paragraph mode
</li><li> Math mode
</li><li> Left-to-right mode, called LR mode for short
</li></ul>

<p>Mode changes occur only when entering or leaving an environment, or when
LaTeX is processing the argument of certain text-producing commands.
</p>
<p><em>Paragraph mode</em> is the most common; it&#8217;s the one LaTeX is in
when processing ordinary text.  In this mode, LaTeX breaks the
input text into lines and breaks the lines into pages.
</p>
<p>LaTeX is in <em>math mode</em> when it&#8217;s generating a mathematical
formula, either displayed math or within a line.

<p>In <em>LR mode</em>, as in paragraph mode, LaTeX considers the output
that it produces to be a string of words with spaces between them.
However, unlike paragraph mode, LaTeX keeps going from left to
right; it never starts a new line in LR mode.  Even if you put a
hundred words into an <code>\mbox</code>, LaTeX would keep typesetting
them from left to right inside a single box (and then most likely
complain because the resulting box was too wide to fit on the line).
LaTeX is in LR mode when it starts making a box with an
<code>\mbox</code> command.  You can get it to enter a different mode inside
the box&#8212;for example, you can make it enter math mode to put a
formula in the box.
</p>
<p>There are also several text-producing commands and environments for
making a box that put LaTeX into paragraph mode.  The box made by
one of these commands or environments will be called a <code>parbox</code>.
When LaTeX is in paragraph mode while making a box, it is said to
be in &#8220;inner paragraph mode&#8221; (no page breaks).  Its normal paragraph
mode, which it starts out in, is called &#8220;outer paragraph mode&#8221;.
